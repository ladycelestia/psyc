       "\"all right sorry that this videos taking so long to come I wasn't over my\\nfather's video came out so before I stop this I already know this is a lose-lose\\nsituation there is no winning only losing especially on my end I have made\\nplenty of efforts to try and sort this situation out privately but well I guess that's just not happening anymore\\nobviously this is very serious so I'm gonna refrain from making any jokes in this video I have a tendency to laugh at\\nthings in bad situations as a way to cope or see the bright side but I need\\nto stop doing that and face this head-on also personally I don't think content like this should be monetized however\\nI'm gonna be putting ads across this video and putting all the money made from this video and giving it to various\\nsuicide prevention charities for reasons I'll talk about later in the video all\\nthe charities I'm going to be giving the money to will be description down below I also want to ask you guys not to pick\\nsides or switch sides so easily or just jump on the bandwagon because of one\\nvideo myself and Deji have both made mistakes and the best scenario is for\\nboth of us to succeed so please refrain from on subbing or sending hate to\\ndiging that being said i'm gonna go through every point my brother has made and essentially defend myself so looking\\nback at the videos we used to do in 2012 obviously it started innocent the games you were playing I'm just because the\\nlaughing was funny it was literally a bundle of fun and it was content for you\\nguys to enjoy it was hilarious so obviously it all started off with just an innocent slap a few chat a few Q&A is\\nlike slap desi slaughter gee [Music]\\ninnocent obviously I saw the fun side of it too because like at the time it was funny\\neverybody found it funny in the comments everyone was just having a laugh but through the progression of those videos\\nthat we did you know my brother the second channel slowly it progressively it starts to get more violent from\\nthrowing controllers honestly yes\\nalright so with this clip I was play fighting when I was punching you and that's why you started laughing so with\\nthis clip when I threw the controller I never actually hit you however the intent was still there so I'm sorry for\\nthat you need a piss off you for playing\\nFifa playing Fifa still in your video you removed the laughter with this clip\\nyes I did throw the bottle but again why did you call out the laughter\\nnow with this clip you implied that I hit you with the belt but if you watch\\nthe rest of the video I never actually I\\nwon that and with the chocolate I'm sorry this was just wrong with me to do obviously honesty is a big thing and I\\njust love spending time with my brother Lilly you do see as a big thing that's why you've made this point in the video\\nit's a shame because you never once told me that you weren't comfortable with any\\nof the videos that we were making you\\neven had videos on your channel attacking me like slavery fee for the rematch I mean it's not like it was a\\none-way street you got to whip me - you even reacted to the slavery fee four\\nyears after and showed how much you enjoyed it I was mad happy about this cuz off the first one to score\\n[Music]\\nyou even asked me to be in your video to hit you in the truthful dive video but\\nbest friend basically we're doing this thing it's called truth or die I promise can ask me questions if he thinks I'm\\nlying then you'll slap me and he thinks I'm telling the truth then he doesn't slap me - yeah you even made a Q&A\\nSunday where you slapped me and called the video Q&A Sunday slot que si all\\nright especially I'm gonna a good slap JJ this\\nwhat are you doing you want to fight for this it was all just playful fun\\nsiblings always fight I don't understand why it's a problem now maybe I took it\\ntoo far sometimes well not once did you ever bring it up that I made you feel\\nuncomfortable until now I guess I mean you've even made a video where you gloat\\non how you've made me cry in the past have you ever made your brother cry like a baby oh yes yes yes yes yes I have\\npunched his balls once and he cried then again I would try to that as well so but\\nyeah I just I didn't think anything of it I sure my brother I like I'd I just I\\njust didn't think it was that deep honestly I would like coming back from school one of the main things I'd love\\nto do is just play a scary game or anything with my brother that was honestly that was amazing at the time it\\nwas I loved it and it's still one of those memories I cherish today but then too much became too much because as you\\ncan see in some of the videos you can see my discomfort I often felt uncomfortable and I got tired of just\\nbeing a laughing post really I got tired of it even back then I would just simply\\nwalk out I would just walk out because it wasn't funny I didn't like it\\nwell you've given up no I'm leaving yeah\\nyeah yeah I'm gonna count to five not either time every more fun if we're all together I'm\\nalways in this position no no no imagine\\nhow you were tired of being the laughingstock and that's why you left but in one of the clips you showed all I\\nwanted was for you to just sit closer next to me while we played a scary game\\nlook how far away but this will be more\\nfun if we're all together no I guess the\\nnext part will come when he starts to Milo this is not really known but my\\nbrother ended up kicking me out November time 2013 right so I kicked you out\\nbecause you made our house disgusting you never did any chores you refuse to\\nlisten to me when I repeatedly asked you to get rid of all the rubbish that you\\nmade from constantly ordering takeaways and never cleaning up after yourself you\\nnever washed up after yourself you never washed the dishes you just never helped around the house\\nso I just got sick and tired of constantly having to clean up after you and that's why I told mom and dad to\\npick you up after I kicked you out the house in hindsight maybe it was wrong of me to kick you out the house so suddenly\\nbut if I was to be honest after refusing to listen to me time and time again and\\nyou just not cleaning up you're right I'm sorry but I just had to tell you to leave when five years later this is the\\nsame reason me Josh and Simon also wanted to kick you out the Seidman house you're 22 years old\\nman you you need to learn to clean up after yourself and it's not my responsibility or anyone elses other\\nthan your own to do that I mean it just wasn't fair on me or my housemates when\\nwe offered you a room rent-free in our\\nhouse to help you with training Deji man you were you were constantly inviting\\nrandom girls from tinder and Bumble to our house our chef was making food while\\nyou were finding ways to not eat it or hide it or we'll just throw it away\\nand don't get me wrong like I tried to defend you eventually everyone just got fed up of you just taking advantage of\\nthe whole situation and Vic Josh and Simon can all back me up on this win today\\nchallenges with my brother pain is a recurring theme I mean even our latest challenge we've done consists of pain\\nand you guys can see for yourself that pain is a very recurring theme with my\\nbrother with many challenges challenge videos where pain is involved is not an\\nexclusive thing to just you digi on many occasions on mine and other people's\\nchannels we have both agreed to play a game with a forfeit like being electrocuted or being shot with a BB gun\\nor being shot with a paintball gun jumping into nettles so yeah pain is a recurring theme it's a recurring theme\\nthroughout the whole of my channel and in videos I've been in with other youtubers I've never once forced you to\\ndo something you're not comfortable with nor with any other youtuber they're just forfeits it's part of the game nothing\\nnothing exclusive to you dudes all the idea of me wanting to inflict pain\\non to you even with the latest video we did together you liked the idea and agreed to do it especially since we both\\nhad trained for boxing matches and quite frankly the hits we were giving each other were nowhere near as brutal as the\\nhits we got during training I mean we've even sparred together like we've punched each other in the face so I don't\\nunderstand how that video was my idea of wanting to inflict pain on to you I mean\\nI've done this style of video with Vidal and Randle I mean even you do challenges\\nwhere you harm yourself and make yourself vomit for entertainment and that's that's just the image everything\\nwe do we do it all for entertainment and that's it I never forced you to do any\\nof these videos either way I'm sorry if you weren't comfortable with any of the videos that\\nwe've made and I would have hoped that you could at least have told me at the time that you weren't comfortable also\\nwe have done plenty of videos where there is no pain at all they try not to\\nlaugh with my bro would you rather with my bro and if you want to come back at me saying that none of those videos I\\nmentioned are challenges then we did the whisper challenge and there was no pain\\ninvolved in that late 2015 I was doing videos with this girl on everything long story short\\njayjay knowing that I talked to her done videos with her and everything it just\\ncame as a surprise when I found out that my brother had slept with her and that\\nreally did affect me now I can understand you being upset I slept with\\nthis woman but the way you make it out like I had malicious intent towards you\\nthat's just not true so let me explain I met her at a jammie concert she was outside I said hi we\\nexchanged numbers we talked for a bit we met up at a hotel we slept together and that was it I didn't even know she knew\\nyou I don't even remember your name even being mentioned for all I knew she was\\njust a girl that I met at a concert I didn't even see her in any of your videos I mean Deji I can't go to every girl\\nthat I meet and are stem if they know you did I'm sorry but I genuinely didn't know anyway I\\nrecently spoke to her about the whole situation in case I was missing anything and well here's what she had to say like\\nas you can see she clearly didn't think that they were a thing so yeah I don't\\nunderstand why you're trying to frame this as if I did this purposely together you if I knew you guys were a thing or\\nhow you felt about her then boy I would not have done anything when I last saw\\nhim I was on the phone and with dunya some of you guys will know dunya I was\\non the phone of her and my brother came in the room and trying to embarrass me I\\nmean I didn't realize we weren't allowed to make fun of each other anymore I mean you've embarrassed me several\\ntimes especially publicly I mean look\\nI mean is it not normal for siblings to have banter between themselves I've\\nhonestly never seen the jokes that we do as a big deal from my point it's just\\nfriendly banter between brothers I mean I would have loved for you to have told me personally how you felt about these\\nvideos or the banter between us I mean if I knew it was a serious issue for you I would have stopped but you know I had\\nto find out via a video on your channel obviously now you're in a place where these jokes are no longer funny to you\\nso I won't publicly mention your name anymore to avoid things like this\\nhappening in the future name a dead YouTube channel Neji I didn't\\nappreciates it considering I'm not friends with the guy really I spent time in America with him\\nbut I didn't see him as a friend but he was close to my brother so I considered him somewhat family but I responded like\\nthis you are literally you want the site meant as well as JJ's [ __ ] you want literally their [ __ ] you're JJ's\\ncameraman he pays your salary I mean you spend more time with JJ than you do your\\nown wife so I do admit my response was definitely out of Lion I should not have\\nmentioned his wife but then his response is complete was completely unnecessary\\ncompletely unnecessary he responded back with a district in his district he pretty much mentions\\neverything regarding our trip to LA he made things that were private public we\\nhad a group chat and he pretty much just made everything in that group share public you're right Simon how that's\\nthat you won't be sticky cuz you eat paint when you couldn't find its cash listen Clinic see Kappa track what really upset me\\nwhat really really like hurt me during that whole thing was not the diss track\\nit was how my brother reacted to his diss track instead of my brother keeping neutral or\\neven sticking up for me instead he decided instead he was sticking up for\\nhis friend claiming that everything he said in his district was true I was\\nbeing neutral I even said it in the beginning of the video oh man my bro\\nversus one of my best mates I mean I'm in the middle of all of this it's not me\\nit's also why are you getting annoyed at me for saying true wall Randall said\\nwhen you've done the exact same thing\\n[Laughter] [Music]\\nalright lion he is sweet face did she is hiding his girlfriend not\\nonce have I ever said anything about it until now also when it came to your district I begged you all\\nI guess he's had a whole year to work on\\nhis craft this yeah this actually banks but you never included that just saying everything every allegation in his\\ndistrict was true and I just I took that as a low blow instead of supporting me\\nhe decided to support his friend every allegation in Randall's first this track is true okay I'm not going to lie to the\\naudience that's I'm sorry this but that's just not me also it's not fair to discredit Randolph by lying and saying\\nit's not true just for your benefit listened edge literally in your video this is what you said in his district he\\npretty much mentioned everything regarding our trip to LA he made things\\nthat were private public we had a group chat and he pretty much just made\\neverything in that group chat public like you even said it yourself these aren't allegations if there's\\nproof these are just hard facts Randolph is one of my oldest and closest friends and he has done so much for me I'm sorry\\nthat's but I'm not gonna just turn on him for making a diss track on you just because we're related you're not my only\\nloyalty I was in a tough position and that is why I wanted to remain neutral\\nhonestly I felt betrayed I was thought my brother would having my back in dark\\ntimes but as I look at the previous years it looks like my problem doesn't really\\nsupport me like the love we both have is not reciprocal this is one of the\\nreasons why I dropped the diss track on my brother say I don't support you but I have publicly and privately I even made\\na public video back in December where I mentioned all the times that I had supported you you said I've never\\nsupported you but did come on and you know that's not true you know that's not true when you were training\\nfor the fight I was there to help you remember how how important I said cardio\\nwas remember when I took those photos of you of what you'd look like before and\\nafter remember when I was telling you how to spar with Gib telling you how to pace yourself when you were in the ring\\nI was also telling you how to work on your defense and like different ways to defend the jab and defend a cross etc\\nand remember the amount of times we just spa together ditch the amount of times\\neven when you were playing for a night I was there in your room just saying let's\\ntrain let's train let's get ready for this fight like I was there supporting you and even before that remember the\\namount of videos we've done together to help your channel grow would like dead come on you cannot say I have not\\nsupported you even though videos when it came to diss tracks you know I don't\\nexpect that in my response JJ's friend his district or me in my district I said\\na controversial bar of that JJ paid for his wedding nor the tack on JJ it was an\\nattack on JJ's friend the one thing\\nmy broker angry of me show screenshots that he paid for his friend's wedding\\nand I admit it was that that was out of line I I do admit I should not have I\\nshould not have done that it was it was more out of anger I'm glad\\nthat you admit this is wrong even our anger it was out of line but then she was still lying you're saying I\\npay for Randall's wedding but you know and I know that isn't true it was a wedding gift and I was it to be honest I\\ncan't blame me for this I was my mom's error for showing you my bank details for a distract right now you're looking\\nat my mom's phone and these are the messages that she's sending to my bro so\\nI managed to unlock my mom's phone by using the face recognition feature and\\nthen I ran in to a room and locked the door and then proceeded to film the conversation but what really cemented me\\ndoing a diss track on my brother which what really just betrayed me was my\\nbrother's friends in his second District on me but not what was sent in the\\ndistrict it's the fact that my brother heard the diss track before it went out\\nand he didn't try and stop it which which gave me more of a desire to do a\\ndiss track on my brother huh I would take a bullet for you brother but if the trick is same in nature as\\nwell as in his second district on me he shows a private video that was between me and my brother in his district of us\\nsparring which was just between my cell phone and my breath and that was in his\\ndistrict cry sparring quit before we did which further shows that my brother\\nplayed a part to his second district why would I stop a district that has nothing\\nto do with me why is it my place to tell Randolph what he can and can't upload like I said I was trying to be neutral\\nin this whole situation and not get involved it was awkward for me because it was between one of my best friends\\nand my brother but you're the one that dragged me into all of this by making a diss track on me\\nplus the clip that I gave to Randolph isn't at all damaging to you\\nI don't ask me if I had any sparring footage for his music video and I did so\\nI gave it to him that's it I mean I admit it doesn't look like I was helping him with his district but I can promise\\nyou that genuinely wasn't the case here I'm being honest with the sparring footage you don't even look bad if\\nanything is sure that we were at least training for the fight and I was helping you with training plus the sparring clip\\nwas so minimal in the video that I'm struggling to find why you're so upset\\nabout it now what was said and his second district was criminal it ruined\\nmy credibility and it Defamation my character allegations of me getting a\\ngirl pregnant and then leaving her and other things with underage girls and\\nstuff like that the allegations in the district were far from the truth they\\nweren't true at all and another fact that he heard the district before it went out further just\\nput me in a dark place how can you disprove an allegation simply by saying it's not true when\\nthere is evidence I'll explain more about this point near the end of the video balls go through my head I\\ncouldn't explain because I have done nothing but support my brother\\neverything this isn't true you've ridiculed me several times over the\\nyears especially during the time I got banned at Eurogamer I mean that's not supportive at all even tweets like this\\nare ridiculous brothers meant to stick by you no matter what have your back no\\nmatter what no matter what so you go on and Logan pools podcast when I asked you\\nnot to is you having my back no matter what making a diss track on me is you\\nhaving my back no matter what I mean you literally reacted to Quebecers diss track and said this you know what's\\nfunny I like a recorder insecure is like you can JJ I'm so sorry you're angry hairline so\\n[ __ ] up your barber is oh because my\\nman has a big full head oh okay keep that hidden you so scared why would\\nyou hide anymore is that your girlfriend oh he is hiding his girlfriend\\nall right lion he is sweet face JJ is hiding his girlfriend I am actually impressed I was not expecting flames\\nmaybe you could teach TJ one or two things this is from his brother my fam\\nseriously how are you gonna have a go at me not being neutral and then you go and do this I mean clearly you don't\\npractice what you preach saying that family should always have your back no matter what now\\nin my district on my brain everything is known fact everything I say in the\\ndistrict is known facts I don't spill any secrets nothing everything is known fact\\nwell I've disproved the majority of what you've said so now what you can't say everything in the district was known\\nfact when there are things that are just not true for example this is a lie I've\\nnever fought to go in a caravan why are you making false claims about me where is your evidence it's my parents wine\\nget rid of me this was also a lie I didn't want to get rid of you I wanted to talk to mom and dad without you there\\nbecause I know how much you can manipulate them when you're there I mean surely I'm allowed to talk to my parents\\nprivately without you having to be there also this wasn't a known fact at all how\\nwould anyone else other than me and you know this you're the one that made it no\\nhow is this a known fact this is literally your opinion you even fed lies\\nto your friends in your district maybe for teknostart but you're on your fourth for [ __ ] this isn't known or\\nfact I never baited Deji out for texting those girls at any point in time not\\nonce did I mention those tanks it was entirely in Randall's dish and the fact that he said that I'm on my\\nfor for portion it's not only untrue it is extremely disrespectful and you can't\\ndeny that you didn't tell JLo because you said on Logan Paul's podcast I'm one\\nof our abortions yeah yeah I'm on about bosoms yeah what about abortions so um he's\\nlike well your boy right there said before whoa later lyric in the song is fourth abortion he's had like pregnancy\\nskills scares are bit like how we cannot produce these guys like you actually had\\nto go pregnant to the point that that you know they have to go to a clinic four times wow it's bright man it's\\nLaura is that true dog cuz that that lines kind of a yeah yeah that's heavy\\nyeah hate to see that none of this will be out in the public without you exposing it in the district so you\\nreally can't say that your district is based on known facts well my district my brother gave me\\npermission to upload it permission was given he said you cannot blow the\\ndistrict upon me uploading like this track of my brother look and Paul invited me to his podcast so what what\\nmade you comfortable coming on impassive today because my beef isn't really with you and I guess I did have beef with\\nJake but it was mainly just to sell the fight that was the main reason so like it's not I know he said when on the\\nShane Dawson think that he wanted to kill me and stuff he did yeah he said\\nit's because I just felt betrayed I felt hurt and in all honesty I was just tired\\nof doing anything my brother wanted me to do okay so this is the issue with you\\nyou're not consistent with how you act towards me I was so reluctant in saying\\nthat it was okay for you to put up the diss track but I let it slide because I knew it would help your channel but\\ngoing on Logan Paul's podcast I told you I didn't want you to go on it and you can't say that online because here's the\\ntext between us\\nhow do you think it made me feel to see my own brother openly discuss our issues\\nwith the one guy I hate that is completely different to a dis tract which I knew would help your channel but\\ngetting Logan involved and going on his podcast had no other purpose than to\\nbetray me not once have I done something like that to you I mean how is that\\njustified by me staying neutral when you had beef with Randall I'm sorry dizzy\\nbut you can't just pick and choose when you want to listen to my opinion on a\\nsituation that suits you and then expect me to be okay with it so I went on loading Paul's podcasts I saw as a way\\nto just branch out from my bro I honestly did so you thought go on and\\nlook on Paul's podcast to talk about me was the best way to branch out for my\\nbro we went on there to talk about something else than fine but you didn't it was all pretty much about me the best\\nway H to branch out from me is to not talk about me at all\\nand then on top of that make good quality content that your fans would\\nenjoy does he have a god complex is it that's what I mean like his ego is ya insane he's like here is distract to\\ncadet er he compared himself to Ares yo when he when he did the thing with review he said oh my god\\nlike I don't I don't I actually think he thinks he's a god what's going on what's going on with him now getting back to I\\nthink all of that I don't know that's like that's like not me and all of that I have no clue in mashed potatoes and\\nbanging strippers and what is he doing doing does it have anything to do with\\nthe bandana\\nit's just a big forehead behind it that's it right there is like is he's a receding hair why doesn't he get a\\nlittle less forehead he's got money well none of these points were about the diss track these were all unrelated digs\\ntowards me so yet again you're not being accurate with your claims considering I\\nhelped out my brother will this channel a lot by a series that my brother currently\\ndoes called one question go when I saw my brother I showed I showed him a video\\nwhere a guy got his fans to just ask him questions on discord and I told him that\\nhe should do something similar to that and no credit was given to me when he\\nwhen he did the video he didn't give me any credit at all well dizzy I'm sorry I'm sorry I didn't give you credit for\\nadvising me on doing a video that we both saw but wouldn't you agree that me\\ndoing a one question go video on your channel did way more for you than if I\\njust given you a 10 second shower on one of my one question girl videos financially and viewership wise plus I\\ngiving you advice on several videos like that I nearly got shot video or us doing\\nJarosz on fortnight and I got no credit for that but the difference is I don't care I don't feel the need to have\\ncredit when I'm just helping out my brother so the situation of me keeping my brother out on Christmas has been taken\\nout of context incredibly so my brother and I when I was in LA we agreed to talk\\nbut my brother he didn't come to talk he came to fight instead of coming to talk\\nhe threatened to smash my computer and he was acting irate he was just acting\\nso erratic it was I couldn't explain it upon threatening to smash my computer I\\nlocked myself in my office just so he couldn't do sir and little did I know\\nthis whole situation my brother was recording the whole situation which further shows my brother's manipulation\\nconsidering he asked to talk we agreed to talk and he came for a fight as I\\nlost myself in my office he did he threatened to smash the door saying he\\nwill smash the door down obviously my parents stopping him for the safety of my parents and due to his behavior I\\nasked him if he could just if he could leave my house or I'll call the police\\nwhich he recorded and took out of context completely so he\\ntweeted this out the the voice message of me saying leave my house or I'll call\\nthe police he tweeted that out causing fans to just turn on me they turned on\\nme not knowing the situation or why I told him why I told him to leave my\\nhouse the fans turned on me further showing how we just manipulated the\\nsituation\\nyou\\n[Music]\\ninitially when I went to see the family on Christmas Day I came to talk\\nI came to reason I came to fix the situation I came to understand why my\\nbrother was so angry at me to the point of him making a dish strike on me and\\nthen when I went my brother my mom my dad pretty much said it was all my fault\\nso losing control and that is why I\\ntweeted that it's always my fault that's how I was made to feel by my\\nfamily it was not me trying to manipulate the situation at all I also\\nwanted my brother to remove the dish because I felt like in order for us to essentially move on the video had to go\\nand he refused so I got upset and I said I would smash his computer and\\nI should have friend him but I was just so annoyed and then that's when he locked himself in his room where the\\ncomputer was and then I said I would smash the door down if he doesn't come\\nout to talk again I was completely out of line but I'm sorry I was just uh I was just so frustrated man I just wanted\\nto talk as a family to resolve the issue privately so then eventually he told me\\nto leave and I did I came to the house to reason but he just wasn't prepared to do so and that's why I tweeted and\\nposted the the audio clip also my brother said I was manipulating the situation by recording our conversations\\nduring Christmas Day but he did exactly the same thing further things happen\\nwhen I asked my brother to leave my house but I'm not gonna mention that I'm\\nnot gonna mention that in this video I have no idea what he's talking about here nothing else happened when I left\\nas you heard in the recording died he used in this video I just accepted the situation was a lost cause and left I\\ndrove back to my house on Christmas Day and that was it he started playing victim on social media saying I kicked\\nhim out on Christmas for no reason whereas there was a huge reason he was\\nhe was he didn't come here to talk frightened like brother to brother he\\ncame here to fight me Reggie I I never said you kicked me out for no reason we\\nboth got annoyed at each other that day you didn't want to talk it through or listen to my perspective you were\\npersistent in blaming me for Randolph dissing you and you said the whole\\nsituation was essentially my fault honestly the beef between you and Randolph had nothing to do with me you\\njust dragged me into it I mean he said he wanted to talk yeah he was recording the whole situation with which is just\\nlike I said it shows manipulation so I too was recording the situation\\nI only started recording when I locked myself in my room in my office because\\nhe wasn't acting like he wanted to talk he was acting like he wanted to fight me I wasn't trying to fight you at all I\\nnever laid a finger on you this caused us to have a back-and-forth on Twitter but of course as he has more\\nfollowers as he had as he was playing victim people were just ignoring me\\nthey weren't take they were just saying that I was lying that they anything I\\nsaid just didn't matter the amount of followers or fans\\nsomeone has doesn't determine whether they're right or wrong you recorded the\\nwhole conversation as well you could have shown how out of context my voice\\nmemo was but you did it this caused me to get hates of all social medias I\\nstarted to lose subscribers fans and I\\neven starts again for so if maybe life was better off without me if I was\\nhonest I I was just saying what was what\\nwas the point Deji I I never ever ever ever ever ever want you to have thoughts like that I\\nnever want you to feel like that at all and it pains me it pains me that you've\\nfelt like that because of a disagreement between us you should always know you\\ncould talk to me especially if you're having dark thoughts or just feeling low\\nI'm always here for you whether we're on good times or bad terms whenever you message me I always replied\\nedge I want you to succeed in everything you do but dead you man you have to\\ncommunicate with me how or how else am I going to know how you're feeling\\nand this isn't just directed at Deji if any of you watching this have thoughts\\nlike this then you should 100% know that someone [ __ ] cares for you\\nand loves you you you should never feel alone and yeah that's why I'm giving all\\nthe money made on this video to suicide prevention charities because suicide\\nshould never should never be the answer\\nif I'm honest I've always been alone in this YouTube scene I've always been a\\nlone wolf who the only people who really done videos with are in my family my\\nbrother and my parents that's that's just not true Deji you've done videos\\nwith many other youtubers Marcus Butler the raka raka twins dax crypt jello and\\nmany many many women there are loads of youtubers who would love to do videos\\nwith you you 100% definitely not alone in this youtube Seend edge this further\\ncaused me to get hate and i asked my brother if he could stop trash-talking\\nme in videos where his only responsibles for me to delete the district but then going back to my brothers texts at the\\nend of the day it's just a diss track it isn't just a diss track though it's a\\ndiss track at your own brother this is just completely different man you're publicly backstabbing your own\\nbrother this isn't just a youtube feud anymore it's a family one now my brother laughed at the situation and reacted to\\nthe district reacted to my video still on him and was just making fun of the\\nsituation so the little respect I had I\\ntook it and I reverted the diss track wedgie I'm sorry ok this was extremely insensitive but\\nlike I said in the beginning of this video me laughing at the situation helped me get through it last December hands down\\nman the worst month of them of my life man if you arks anyone around me how I was\\nfeeling during December they would all tell you that I was miserable I hated that month and I never ever want\\nto relive it again you weren't the only one that was affected the district had been made private and I then told my\\nbrother to stop trash-talking me in videos which he did not stop he carried\\non trash-talking me in videos even after I put the district down dead there is no\\nevidence of you telling me to stop trash-talking you please show me you telling me to stop trash-talking you\\nafter you pirated the music video quite frankly it it never happened besides I\\nnever even trash talk to you I literally was just laughing at memes I was\\nliterally laughing it means that were created by you coming at me for no reason like I said I'd rather laugh than\\ncry and it's not like I was even encouraging it I literally told my audience to stop making them so a\\nrecurring thing that I found out about my brother is that he tends to attack people when they're down so for instance\\nJoella after being him in this in the whole fight he still continued to bash\\nhim for no reason all right let's see how much well as improved holy crap yes\\nyou punched oh my god he's improved Wow did you attacked Joella as well\\nliterally three months after I fought it\\nwas like he's been smash the bracelet all right the home base for this let me\\nsee them another example is net nobody\\nwhen it's going through a whole custody battle for his son against this baby mama while he was having beef with JJ JJ\\ndecided I'll let me get his baby mama in my district which obviously I town he\\nwould be okay with there's no way in hell we tends to the tapi pool when\\nthey're at their lowest point if you for him so terrible why did you act like this when you were reacting to my dish\\n[Music]\\n[Music] tends to attack people when they're at\\ntheir lowest points which is something I want to plow up there and to those two I\\nwant to say I'm sorry for playing party to it [ __ ] you've done the exact same thing though you can't just change your\\ntune to fit your argument and make me look like the bad guy also how is this\\nyou defending yourself you literally just said I'm just putting this out there and you're attacking me now my\\nbrother also uses subliminal messaging against me for example he'll say that he\\nwants his second channel to take over my main channel to which his fans will try\\nand accomplish considering he as a mutt he's much bigger than me much bigger\\nthan me like she sees everything as a competition between us whereas I don't I\\ndon't have competition with family but it seems like he he does I'll admit I am\\na competitive person that is why I am in the position I'm in today to put it\\nquite simply I do not like to lose I'm sorry but I don't see how you can get anywhere without being at least a little\\nbit competitive so yeah I don't understand why this is a bad thing to have this is what makes me want to be\\nsuccessful and even within family sibling rivalry is toe a normal thing we're in a competitive\\nindustry we have to do what we can to stay on top you she was a huge platform yeah he wants to overtake my channel\\nwhich will result in me losing subscribers for his game vej listen I\\nthis is gonna be a revelation for you why do you care so much if I overtake you in subs do you know why you care so\\nmuch it's because you're competitive I mean realistically it's not even that deep\\nI've lost millions of subscribers in my time I now news this subscribers right now but you still don't see me\\ncomplaining in my whole youtubing career I have lost seven point six million\\nsubscribers Dage come on man eight that deed so he would say something and then\\nend it with I'm joking whereas he's not joking he's serious about the message\\nwhereas people will obviously take this as him being serious it's just that I'm\\njoking is just a defense mechanism\\nNeji I'm kidding it's a joke it's a joke ditch this is all the joke please do not\\nmake a video about me please do not go in on me please don't play me or the victim please Digi\\nthis is just banter this is just friendly competition that is all okay just some fun bravo rivalry that another\\npiece of subliminal messaging my brother does is he shows him unsubscribing from\\nmy channel in a video which will result in his fans also unsubscribing from my\\nchannel so from all of this it's clear\\nthat you do care about subscribers otherwise you wouldn't bring it up God knows why because you literally don't\\nget paid from subscribers pretty much just a number these days people unsubscribe from you because I did and\\nclearly they weren't fans in the first place or maybe they are fans and they're just trolling but ditch who cares\\nend of the day it's your content that makes people interested in you put up bad content eventually people\\naren't gonna care about it anymore subscribers don't affect your livelihood did it affects your ego and that's just\\nit he also told his fans to tweet me to delete my channel but on Twitter\\nnot my YouTube channel because that would give me views to his channel because I'll get the views I'd say just\\ntweet him tweet him saying delete your channel but obviously his fans still wrote this on my channel as well he's\\nbasically using his fans to attack me also known as mob mentality another\\npiece of subliminal messaging that my brother uses is him saying that I'm just\\ntrying to reach ten million subs that I betrayed him just to try and reach ten\\nmillion subs which is far from the truth considering I if anybody knows me they\\nknow I don't focus on numbers I didn't even know how to look at analytics\\nyou're massively contradicting yourself as I've just said it's clear that you do\\ncare about the numbers why would you even make a video faking getting a diamond play button if you don't care\\nabout the numbers you even said this in the video I've been stuck on nine point seven million subscribers for the\\nlongest time on this channel every six months or so and that doesn't care about numbers and subscribers you seem very\\naware of the fact that you have been on nine point seven million subscribers for\\nsix months I've never even done two million three million four or five going\\nsomeone's special I've never done a milestone video special the only one\\nI've ever done is 1 million 1 million subscribers what even is this sentence\\nthat's like saying you've never ever punched anyone in the face besides that one time you punch someone in the face\\nultimately you still punch someone in the face so you can't say you've never made a subscriber milestone video\\nbecause you have anyway it's clear that you do care about numbers even pointless numbers like subscribers\\nthere's no point claiming you don't when everything you're saying shows that you do care so just say that you can just be\\nhonest how can I blame him for caring about numbers when I used to do the exact same thing I used to be obsessed with how\\nmany subscribers I had how many followers I had on Instagram how many views I got on my videos etc I was\\nalways focused on finding ways to increase my numbers to the point where I was doing videos that I just wasn't\\npassionate about but I did it because I knew it would get me the views I wasn't making videos for me anymore and that's\\nwhy I left in 2017 yeah I just wasn't happy at all so after my break I made\\nsure I never focused on numbers ever again and instead did everything for me\\nif I'm passionate about something then people will see that and enjoy the\\ncontent with me I mean there's enough people in the world someone's gonna enjoy something you enjoy doing but yeah\\nI know we live in a society where everyone just focuses on numbers these days man so sometimes it's good to just\\nstep back and you know just don't worry about that he unfollowed me on all\\nsocial media platforms but I never unfollowed him so what he did he blocked me on Instagram and then unblocked me\\njust to make it look like I unfollowed him when he unfollowed me when I followed him back if you understand what\\nI mean as people got a notification that I followed him which also shows signs of manipulation edge I got annoyed when you\\nuploaded that this strike that's why I impulse Lee unfollowed you it's got\\nnothing to do with manipulation I've always been scared to stand up to my brother considering he has more social\\npower social media power than me like he has more social media friends than I do\\nso I've always just been very scared to stand up for myself well you weren't\\nafraid to stand up for yourself when you made the whole district on me even told me in front of our parents to stop\\ntalking to his YouTube friends which is one reason why you don't really see me\\ndoing collaborations with other youtubers like I said earlier in the video you have done videos of other\\nyoutubers and edge I never told you to stop talking to my friends why why would\\nI say now you can make videos with any of my friends why I stopped how can I stop you every\\nyoutuber wants to do a video with you then they're gonna do a video with you also that you've gotta remember that\\nit's not just a one-way street you can't just expect people to ask you to do collabs you sometimes have to reach out\\nfor yourself because you know where's\\nthe door this is just two robbers fine\\nI'm not bringing you down I was just annoyed that you that you didn't want to\\nplay the scary game also you literally called me dumb as well and I even apologized at the end so we could just\\ncontinue with the video we're not gonna just agree on everything we do we're gonna clash and have arguments so why\\ndoes that make me a bad person I couldn't learn it because I me personally I just I didn't like it I\\ndidn't might be I didn't like the way he was talking to me I didn't like the way he treated me or anything I just I just\\ncouldn't upload it I just I just don't like being belittled I mean you're doing the exact same thing to me in this video\\nand you don't see me complaining I swear\\nI looked I saw I looked everywhere\\nthere's no one there so bad even some of my fans have realized that my brother doesn't he doesn't it doesn't\\nlook like he wants to do videos with me just from his body language it makes it look like he just feels forced to be in\\nvideos with me there's you're not the only one I do this for I do this on other people's channels as well he's\\nsaying anything that seems familiar um any I guess it could be down here I\\nhave no idea mmm it also sang with an intro video that's\\njust how I am did sometimes I'm just not in the mood sometimes I'm just tired sometimes I just can't be bothered you\\nknow I'm not fake I'm not gonna pretend that I have energy 100 percent of the time or I'm not gonna pretend I'm\\nexcited all the time about everything that I do I'm just gonna be me if I'm just air slumps like this like I'm still\\ndoing the video I I mean I don't know how this is the point really cuz yeah that's that's just me man\\nmy brother is acting like he has not done anything anything wrong in this whole situation\\nwhen he goes on podcast or anything he just acts like he's the victim in the\\nwhole situation he just acts like I did everything everything is my fault and\\nthat really pains me because that makes the fans think that I'm the bad guy\\nI'm the one who started all this ya know I'm just old enough is that is it\\nliterally like no no I don't care I won't follow them I you know I don't\\ncare anymore he's these ladies bird now you can rest in it just makes me believe me he's just\\nso far gone in his own ego for him to not realize what he's doing that I'm not\\nsaying I'm a victim I'm just saying the truth I'm not trying to manipulate the\\nsituation I just want this to be over and done with I want my point of view to be expressed\\nas much as you want yours I mean I've been trying to keep this as private as possible\\nand that's why I haven't really said much on the whole matter but now it's clear to me from your video that you are\\nupset with the whole situation and that's why I want to make things right that's why I'm making this video I'll\\nadmit I need to work on being closer with mom and dad and that's why recently\\nI've you know come to the house more often I also hate you up for us to do videos together because I was trying to\\nhelp improve things on your channel I've also tried to communicate with you more as well so you know I'm actively trying\\nto make things better but obviously you just want me to say this publicly so\\nthat is why I'm doing this video and that's why I'm responding to you my\\nbrother thinks he knows me but he really doesn't know anything about me\\nhe doesn't even know much about my parents I have never said I know you in fact I definitely do not know you nor\\ndo you know me and that's why we need to work on this relationship as a family he doesn't even know my parents birthdays\\nmy dad had to remind my brother of when my mom's birthday was my dad had to Rome\\nmight literally remind him on the day that it's you know our mom's birthday\\nshe's just sad honestly it's sad I'm sorry dizzy but people forget I was\\nreally busy at the time I was in Dubai I was supporting Fordow of his fight and\\nit's not like I left it for like a week I literally woke up in the middle of the night and messaged my mom instantly yes\\nI forgot but it doesn't mean that I don't care I sent her a message as soon as my dad reminded me my mom's birthday\\nis made the fourth our dad's birthday is August 28th and your birthday is\\nDecember the 9th people forget nitch I'm sorry Irene said happy birthday to you\\nlast year and you never replied by the way how is this you defending yourself\\nour parents is birthday have nothing to do with us not knowing each other at this point you're literally just\\nattacking me you're trying to make me look as bad as possible you're trying to make it look like I don't care about the\\nfamily I thought the intention of your video was to defend yourself not attack me I was bringing up that I was\\nlate to wish my mom a happy birthday defending yourself how is it anything to\\ndo with you at all my brother even called my dad saying that he was going to destroy my channel and then after\\nthat call these are the texts that proceeded after him saying that if my\\ndad recorded the call that he would copyright strike the video and his and\\nit's very sad that my brother assumes that my dad would do something disgusting like that [ __ ] if I had said\\nthat it would have been in the heat of the moment I know I impulsively say things that I don't mean when I get\\nangry or upset it's something I'm definitely working on it I do not want\\nyour channel to be destroyed I want us both to succeed people will take this\\nthe wrong way and see this as an attack but this is literally just me sticking up for myself for years I've been\\nsuppressed but me making this video I don't want any negativity towards my brother from what you've heard in this\\nvideo please I did not make this video for my brother to get hate or any negativity I simply made this video\\nbecause I have to stick up for myself I'm tired of people see me as the bad guy or they don't know the full\\nsituation edge you knew perfectly well that you making this video would get me\\nhate otherwise you will have approached me privately in the description you even said that you don't want to be seen as\\nthe bad guy anymore so do you want me to be seen as the bad guy now there's there's no bad guys or\\ngood guys in this whole situation we both made mistakes and I know even\\nthough I don't want it that you might get a bit of hate from this video unfortunately this is a byproduct of us\\ndoing this publicly it's something that we just have to live with and accept anyway I'll say this again I think it's\\nbest for us to do this privately man all right and that's the first video done so\\nin preparing for this video my brother uploaded it's another video in anticipation of my reply a to be honest\\nI can only see this as an attempt to damage control but yeah I guess how to\\ngo through this second video as well now and defend myself yet again so let's do\\nthis as tweets after I uploaded my video further shows his immaturity towards the\\nsituation here are some of his tweets\\nit's actually sickening when I look at it because this is a serious situation\\nand he's treating it like a joke so that all of these tweets were made before I even watched your video I know it was\\nwrong of me to judge the video before even watching it but I saw the description and I saw the thumbnail and\\nthe title and I was like ah here we go again is another video of him going at me that's why I tweeted the meme and\\nshowed my audience that I did not want to go through why I went through again in December and then once I watched the\\nvideo I knew I had to respond and take this seriously so I'm sorry for not\\ninitially initially initially oh my god initially I'm sorry for not initially\\ntaking this seriously he even sent me a text saying congratulations completely missing the\\nwhole point of my video well ditch I'm not gonna lie this is truly how I feel the timing of your video just doesn't\\nlook good on your part and you have to admit this so you just happen to feel like this a week after the whole James\\nCharles Sharma where it also started with a 14 minute exposing video that blew up massively\\nyou just happen to bring this all out at a time when you were losing subscribers and your views were down and don't even\\ntry and say that you don't care about subscribers or numbers because we've already established that you clearly do\\nI mean did you can't deny the similarities and the timings everyone knows how badly you want to hit 10\\nmillion subscribers to the point of view even freaking getting the 10 million\\nsubscriber Platt yeah if this is how you wanna do it then I guess fine what really upset me it's not that my\\nbrother's gonna be responding is that my brother is trying to dig up dirt in his\\nresponse towards me he tweeted out you know if anybody has any stories with me\\nto damn him and if it's just it said that he's now\\ngoing that path he's going the path of destruction all right so let me explain\\nthis tweet yes I was annoyed yes initially I wanted to highlight some of\\nthe allegations that I have heard against you regarding women I wanted to\\nbring them to your attention to make you realize that what you've been doing is wrong I'm sorry about it was just\\nfrustrating that in your video you were claiming that you had done nothing wrong\\nand that all of the allegations were just false but with so many women coming forward with similar stories these\\nallegations don't look so false to me to be honest and too earnest your second\\nvideo just adds to the credibility of these women why would you make your video to defend yourself when you don't\\neven know what I'm going to say why would you go so far as to threaten me with legal action when you don't even\\nknow what the allegations are if you didn't think that there was some truth in them then you wouldn't have anything\\nto worry about but because they're just allegations I'm not going to publicly address instead I'm gonna privately send you the\\nstories that these women have come forward with I hope that you do the right thing in first acknowledging that\\nyou have in the past made several women feel uncomfortable as well as feel\\nmanipulated and then secondly apologizing to these women and any other woman for that matter the whole video\\nwas literally not an attack I did not lie at all in the whole video well we\\nall know now how long true this is I even have a conversation a DM conversation that my brother had with a\\nfan who's obviously conversed with me in the past I just just look for yourself\\nyou\\nthis isn't about me trying to destroy this is about you learning to take\\nresponsibility over your actions you need to own up to your mistakes and apologize and not just the ones you've\\nbeen caught up on I mean your video was supposedly about making me realize what I've done wrong well I'm gonna make you\\nrealize what you've done wrong so I have the screenshots of you talking to her on\\nFacebook the only reason I messaged her was to make sure at the screenshots were real now I know that they are either way\\nI'm not going to share anything publicly because that's just not fair on her but yeah you just you just need own up and\\napologized edge how works herself and I don't want your brother to know I messaged you either because he doesn't\\nseem like a very nice person but when I told him no he was so like desperate and\\nsomewhat manipulative trying to get me to send screenshots and that's her words herself\\nI did not Co herself to say any of this these are her words so she explicitly says I don't want your\\nmother to know that I messaged you so what do you do you post a public video about it and now I know that she\\nmessaged you how is this fair on her you know how you know her you know the first\\nconversation you had with her you know and I know what was said do the right thing\\nown up to your mistakes and apologize with my brother putting that tweet out\\nyou're definitely gonna get people who are going to lie about the situation just to make me look a lot worse a lot\\nworse you don't think I didn't think of that I definitely got a lot of crap from that tweet but I also got a lot of women\\nwith real experiences with you whip screenshots I wasn't interested in\\ntalking to the girls unless they had some sort of evidence to back their story other girls have messaged me as well\\nsharing me their games with my brother I'm not gonna show those themes as this video is not an attack on my brother go\\nahead go ahead show all the d-ends like I I have literally nothing to hide with\\nmy brother's video if he does mention any lies or any form of just\\nmanipulation or anything from the DMS that he's gonna get I won't before\\nto take legal action I would much rather not do that but I would be forced to\\ntake legal action for defamation of character like I said before this is just an extreme action to take against\\nclaims that are supposedly not true I didn't mean to take me in a call over the anticipation of allegation just\\nscreams guilty besides how you gonna take me to court when there's proof I have evidence you can't sue me for\\ndefamation of character if it's true you're not even defending yourself anymore you're just threatening\\nme now what he needs to do is just take responsibility that's it he's older than\\nme just take responsibility I said he's going to attack me\\nI haven't attacked you at all in this video deck I've simply responded and defended myself from everything you have\\nsaid in your video I have taken responsibility and now you need to do the same upon me uploading my video as\\nwell my brother has started to distance himself from my parents to make them feel guilty for getting involved and\\npreventing my brother destroying my livelihood and destroying my credibility I'm not gonna explain what he's doing\\nbut that's what that's the level he's going you're exaggerating this so far\\nbeyond from what it actually is let me explain what I'm doing our parents currently deal with our\\nfinances even before this whole situation blew what I had started to feel like this wasn't such a good idea\\nanymore stuff like this where family always gets complicated and to be honest I just wanted my parents to be my parents again\\nand not just accountants and then with the past few months it's just highlight\\nI definitely do not want my parents to be in charge of my finances I mean our\\nmom went into my private accounts to give my brother false information to use\\nin a district that was public I mean that alone is just it's just crazy and I\\njust feel like I just need more control I mean I'm definitely not distancing myself in an attempt to make them feel\\nguilty I mean why would you even suggest I mean come on this literally has\\nnothing to do with you you're literally trying to manipulate everyone in making me look\\nlike I'm going out of my way to hurt my parents when you know nothing about the\\nsituation all I'm doing is protecting myself I my finances from being burnt in the future and that's it I'm still gonna\\ntalk to my parents I'm still gonna visit our parents I'm still gonna do activities with our parents I'm just\\nremoving the financial side I just want to remove any potential complications that come with it and just focus on\\nbeing a family I know our family is going through a lot because of tank and that's why I also want to remove the\\nhassle of doing my finances during this period but my brother once is he wants\\nmy parents to pick science that's what he wants you know what I want [ __ ] I want you to stop saying my parents and\\ninstead say our parents because I am part of this family too you have made me an outcast throughout\\nall of this you talk to any of our friends and ask them who has caused the most hassle all of them will say you you\\nhave literally made my life a living hell and all for what views subscribers you always say that family comes first\\nbut that's not true is it huh to you to\\nyou the fans come first I've made so many attempts to try and fix our family issues I've even suggested that we go\\nsee a therapist but you just refused I'm\\njust so tired of fighting a losing battle with my own family man I'm tired\\nof feeling like an outcast yes I can do better but so can you man like I'm at\\nthe point where I can't even take take my own girlfriend to see my family\\nbecause I'm scared that she's gonna get exposed and my brother is gonna use that\\ninformation against me I'm scared to even text my family because I'm scared\\nyou're gonna just screenshot the [ __ ] message and just post it publicly and\\nI'm scared to even call my family because I'm scared you're gonna just take one negative thing that I say\\nmanipulate the audience and just make me look as bad as possible I'm just sick\\nand [ __ ] tired of it like I shouldn't\\nhave to feel like this I even have these concerns it's it's stop it's so ridiculous man and you can't\\nexpect me to just fix everything by myself we need to do this as a family we\\nneed to resolve all of our issues as a family I've never been so happy honestly\\nI've never been so happy just going on social media and just seeing all the all\\nthe disappoint that you guys have given me I want to say thank you so much\\nhonestly I thank you so much so all the people who sent me a tweet\\nsent me a DM messaged me on any social media that I have I wanted to say thank\\nyou thank you I really do appreciate it I really do this is the happiest you've\\never been gaining subscribers at the expense of dragging your own brother makes you your happiest airing all of\\nour issues publicly makes you your happiest this type of video shouldn't\\nmake you happy at all it should do the complete opposite you should have told me privately how you've been feeling for\\nme this response video doesn't make me happy at all it makes me physically sick this past\\nweek I've been on tour but the only thing that's been on my mind is your video man I am sick and tired of this\\nwhole [ __ ] situation I just want it to [ __ ] end man none of this should\\nhave been made public either way I'm going to work on trying to resolve all\\nof this I love my family regardless of what I've been put through or what I put\\nDG through I'm gonna work this out I didn't want to reply to this publicly but you know I had to defend myself\\njust like you didn't move your video I just want I\\njust want this to be over man I just want this to be over and done with so\\nplease can let's just be done with this stage and yeah man I'll always love you\\nyeah\""
