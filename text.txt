all right sorry that this videos taking so long to come I wasn't over my
father's video came out so before I stop this I already know this is a lose-lose
situation there is no winning only losing especially on my end I have made
plenty of efforts to try and sort this situation out privately but well I guess that's just not happening anymore
obviously this is very serious so I'm gonna refrain from making any jokes in this video I have a tendency to laugh at
things in bad situations as a way to cope or see the bright side but I need
to stop doing that and face this head-on also personally I don't think content like this should be monetized however
I'm gonna be putting ads across this video and putting all the money made from this video and giving it to various
suicide prevention charities for reasons I'll talk about later in the video all
the charities I'm going to be giving the money to will be description down below I also want to ask you guys not to pick
sides or switch sides so easily or just jump on the bandwagon because of one
video myself and Deji have both made mistakes and the best scenario is for
both of us to succeed so please refrain from on subbing or sending hate to
diging that being said i'm gonna go through every point my brother has made and essentially defend myself so looking
back at the videos we used to do in 2012 obviously it started innocent the games you were playing I'm just because the
laughing was funny it was literally a bundle of fun and it was content for you
guys to enjoy it was hilarious so obviously it all started off with just an innocent slap a few chat a few Q&A is
like slap desi slaughter gee [Music]
innocent obviously I saw the fun side of it too because like at the time it was funny
everybody found it funny in the comments everyone was just having a laugh but through the progression of those videos
that we did you know my brother the second channel slowly it progressively it starts to get more violent from
throwing controllers honestly yes
alright so with this clip I was play fighting when I was punching you and that's why you started laughing so with
this clip when I threw the controller I never actually hit you however the intent was still there so I'm sorry for
that you need a piss off you for playing
Fifa playing Fifa still in your video you removed the laughter with this clip
yes I did throw the bottle but again why did you call out the laughter
now with this clip you implied that I hit you with the belt but if you watch
the rest of the video I never actually I
won that and with the chocolate I'm sorry this was just wrong with me to do obviously honesty is a big thing and I
just love spending time with my brother Lilly you do see as a big thing that's why you've made this point in the video
it's a shame because you never once told me that you weren't comfortable with any
of the videos that we were making you
even had videos on your channel attacking me like slavery fee for the rematch I mean it's not like it was a
one-way street you got to whip me - you even reacted to the slavery fee four
years after and showed how much you enjoyed it I was mad happy about this cuz off the first one to score
[Music]
you even asked me to be in your video to hit you in the truthful dive video but
best friend basically we're doing this thing it's called truth or die I promise can ask me questions if he thinks I'm
lying then you'll slap me and he thinks I'm telling the truth then he doesn't slap me - yeah you even made a Q&A
Sunday where you slapped me and called the video Q&A Sunday slot que si all
right especially I'm gonna a good slap JJ this
what are you doing you want to fight for this it was all just playful fun
siblings always fight I don't understand why it's a problem now maybe I took it
too far sometimes well not once did you ever bring it up that I made you feel
uncomfortable until now I guess I mean you've even made a video where you gloat
on how you've made me cry in the past have you ever made your brother cry like a baby oh yes yes yes yes yes I have
punched his balls once and he cried then again I would try to that as well so but
yeah I just I didn't think anything of it I sure my brother I like I'd I just I
just didn't think it was that deep honestly I would like coming back from school one of the main things I'd love
to do is just play a scary game or anything with my brother that was honestly that was amazing at the time it
was I loved it and it's still one of those memories I cherish today but then too much became too much because as you
can see in some of the videos you can see my discomfort I often felt uncomfortable and I got tired of just
being a laughing post really I got tired of it even back then I would just simply
walk out I would just walk out because it wasn't funny I didn't like it
well you've given up no I'm leaving yeah
yeah yeah I'm gonna count to five not either time every more fun if we're all together I'm
always in this position no no no imagine
how you were tired of being the laughingstock and that's why you left but in one of the clips you showed all I
wanted was for you to just sit closer next to me while we played a scary game
look how far away but this will be more
fun if we're all together no I guess the
next part will come when he starts to Milo this is not really known but my
brother ended up kicking me out November time 2013 right so I kicked you out
because you made our house disgusting you never did any chores you refuse to
listen to me when I repeatedly asked you to get rid of all the rubbish that you
made from constantly ordering takeaways and never cleaning up after yourself you
never washed up after yourself you never washed the dishes you just never helped around the house
so I just got sick and tired of constantly having to clean up after you and that's why I told mom and dad to
pick you up after I kicked you out the house in hindsight maybe it was wrong of me to kick you out the house so suddenly
but if I was to be honest after refusing to listen to me time and time again and
you just not cleaning up you're right I'm sorry but I just had to tell you to leave when five years later this is the
same reason me Josh and Simon also wanted to kick you out the Seidman house you're 22 years old
man you you need to learn to clean up after yourself and it's not my responsibility or anyone elses other
than your own to do that I mean it just wasn't fair on me or my housemates when
we offered you a room rent-free in our
house to help you with training Deji man you were you were constantly inviting
random girls from tinder and Bumble to our house our chef was making food while
you were finding ways to not eat it or hide it or we'll just throw it away
and don't get me wrong like I tried to defend you eventually everyone just got fed up of you just taking advantage of
the whole situation and Vic Josh and Simon can all back me up on this win today
challenges with my brother pain is a recurring theme I mean even our latest challenge we've done consists of pain
and you guys can see for yourself that pain is a very recurring theme with my
brother with many challenges challenge videos where pain is involved is not an
exclusive thing to just you digi on many occasions on mine and other people's
channels we have both agreed to play a game with a forfeit like being electrocuted or being shot with a BB gun
or being shot with a paintball gun jumping into nettles so yeah pain is a recurring theme it's a recurring theme
throughout the whole of my channel and in videos I've been in with other youtubers I've never once forced you to
do something you're not comfortable with nor with any other youtuber they're just forfeits it's part of the game nothing
nothing exclusive to you dudes all the idea of me wanting to inflict pain
on to you even with the latest video we did together you liked the idea and agreed to do it especially since we both
had trained for boxing matches and quite frankly the hits we were giving each other were nowhere near as brutal as the
hits we got during training I mean we've even sparred together like we've punched each other in the face so I don't
understand how that video was my idea of wanting to inflict pain on to you I mean
I've done this style of video with Vidal and Randle I mean even you do challenges
where you harm yourself and make yourself vomit for entertainment and that's that's just the image everything
we do we do it all for entertainment and that's it I never forced you to do any
of these videos either way I'm sorry if you weren't comfortable with any of the videos that
we've made and I would have hoped that you could at least have told me at the time that you weren't comfortable also
we have done plenty of videos where there is no pain at all they try not to
laugh with my bro would you rather with my bro and if you want to come back at me saying that none of those videos I
mentioned are challenges then we did the whisper challenge and there was no pain
involved in that late 2015 I was doing videos with this girl on everything long story short
jayjay knowing that I talked to her done videos with her and everything it just
came as a surprise when I found out that my brother had slept with her and that
really did affect me now I can understand you being upset I slept with
this woman but the way you make it out like I had malicious intent towards you
that's just not true so let me explain I met her at a jammie concert she was outside I said hi we
exchanged numbers we talked for a bit we met up at a hotel we slept together and that was it I didn't even know she knew
you I don't even remember your name even being mentioned for all I knew she was
just a girl that I met at a concert I didn't even see her in any of your videos I mean Deji I can't go to every girl
that I meet and are stem if they know you did I'm sorry but I genuinely didn't know anyway I
recently spoke to her about the whole situation in case I was missing anything and well here's what she had to say like
as you can see she clearly didn't think that they were a thing so yeah I don't
understand why you're trying to frame this as if I did this purposely together you if I knew you guys were a thing or
how you felt about her then boy I would not have done anything when I last saw
him I was on the phone and with dunya some of you guys will know dunya I was
on the phone of her and my brother came in the room and trying to embarrass me I
mean I didn't realize we weren't allowed to make fun of each other anymore I mean you've embarrassed me several
times especially publicly I mean look
I mean is it not normal for siblings to have banter between themselves I've
honestly never seen the jokes that we do as a big deal from my point it's just
friendly banter between brothers I mean I would have loved for you to have told me personally how you felt about these
videos or the banter between us I mean if I knew it was a serious issue for you I would have stopped but you know I had
to find out via a video on your channel obviously now you're in a place where these jokes are no longer funny to you
so I won't publicly mention your name anymore to avoid things like this
happening in the future name a dead YouTube channel Neji I didn't
appreciates it considering I'm not friends with the guy really I spent time in America with him
but I didn't see him as a friend but he was close to my brother so I considered him somewhat family but I responded like
this you are literally you want the site meant as well as JJ's [ __ ] you want literally their [ __ ] you're JJ's
cameraman he pays your salary I mean you spend more time with JJ than you do your
own wife so I do admit my response was definitely out of Lion I should not have
mentioned his wife but then his response is complete was completely unnecessary
completely unnecessary he responded back with a district in his district he pretty much mentions
everything regarding our trip to LA he made things that were private public we
had a group chat and he pretty much just made everything in that group share public you're right Simon how that's
that you won't be sticky cuz you eat paint when you couldn't find its cash listen Clinic see Kappa track what really upset me
what really really like hurt me during that whole thing was not the diss track
it was how my brother reacted to his diss track instead of my brother keeping neutral or
even sticking up for me instead he decided instead he was sticking up for
his friend claiming that everything he said in his district was true I was
being neutral I even said it in the beginning of the video oh man my bro
versus one of my best mates I mean I'm in the middle of all of this it's not me
it's also why are you getting annoyed at me for saying true wall Randall said
when you've done the exact same thing
[Laughter] [Music]
alright lion he is sweet face did she is hiding his girlfriend not
once have I ever said anything about it until now also when it came to your district I begged you all
I guess he's had a whole year to work on
his craft this yeah this actually banks but you never included that just saying everything every allegation in his
district was true and I just I took that as a low blow instead of supporting me
he decided to support his friend every allegation in Randall's first this track is true okay I'm not going to lie to the
audience that's I'm sorry this but that's just not me also it's not fair to discredit Randolph by lying and saying
it's not true just for your benefit listened edge literally in your video this is what you said in his district he
pretty much mentioned everything regarding our trip to LA he made things
that were private public we had a group chat and he pretty much just made
everything in that group chat public like you even said it yourself these aren't allegations if there's
proof these are just hard facts Randolph is one of my oldest and closest friends and he has done so much for me I'm sorry
that's but I'm not gonna just turn on him for making a diss track on you just because we're related you're not my only
loyalty I was in a tough position and that is why I wanted to remain neutral
honestly I felt betrayed I was thought my brother would having my back in dark
times but as I look at the previous years it looks like my problem doesn't really
support me like the love we both have is not reciprocal this is one of the
reasons why I dropped the diss track on my brother say I don't support you but I have publicly and privately I even made
a public video back in December where I mentioned all the times that I had supported you you said I've never
supported you but did come on and you know that's not true you know that's not true when you were training
for the fight I was there to help you remember how how important I said cardio
was remember when I took those photos of you of what you'd look like before and
after remember when I was telling you how to spar with Gib telling you how to pace yourself when you were in the ring
I was also telling you how to work on your defense and like different ways to defend the jab and defend a cross etc
and remember the amount of times we just spa together ditch the amount of times
even when you were playing for a night I was there in your room just saying let's
train let's train let's get ready for this fight like I was there supporting you and even before that remember the
amount of videos we've done together to help your channel grow would like dead come on you cannot say I have not
supported you even though videos when it came to diss tracks you know I don't
expect that in my response JJ's friend his district or me in my district I said
a controversial bar of that JJ paid for his wedding nor the tack on JJ it was an
attack on JJ's friend the one thing
my broker angry of me show screenshots that he paid for his friend's wedding
and I admit it was that that was out of line I I do admit I should not have I
should not have done that it was it was more out of anger I'm glad
that you admit this is wrong even our anger it was out of line but then she was still lying you're saying I
pay for Randall's wedding but you know and I know that isn't true it was a wedding gift and I was it to be honest I
can't blame me for this I was my mom's error for showing you my bank details for a distract right now you're looking
at my mom's phone and these are the messages that she's sending to my bro so
I managed to unlock my mom's phone by using the face recognition feature and
then I ran in to a room and locked the door and then proceeded to film the conversation but what really cemented me
doing a diss track on my brother which what really just betrayed me was my
brother's friends in his second District on me but not what was sent in the
district it's the fact that my brother heard the diss track before it went out
and he didn't try and stop it which which gave me more of a desire to do a
diss track on my brother huh I would take a bullet for you brother but if the trick is same in nature as
well as in his second district on me he shows a private video that was between me and my brother in his district of us
sparring which was just between my cell phone and my breath and that was in his
district cry sparring quit before we did which further shows that my brother
played a part to his second district why would I stop a district that has nothing
to do with me why is it my place to tell Randolph what he can and can't upload like I said I was trying to be neutral
in this whole situation and not get involved it was awkward for me because it was between one of my best friends
and my brother but you're the one that dragged me into all of this by making a diss track on me
plus the clip that I gave to Randolph isn't at all damaging to you
I don't ask me if I had any sparring footage for his music video and I did so
I gave it to him that's it I mean I admit it doesn't look like I was helping him with his district but I can promise
you that genuinely wasn't the case here I'm being honest with the sparring footage you don't even look bad if
anything is sure that we were at least training for the fight and I was helping you with training plus the sparring clip
was so minimal in the video that I'm struggling to find why you're so upset
about it now what was said and his second district was criminal it ruined
my credibility and it Defamation my character allegations of me getting a
girl pregnant and then leaving her and other things with underage girls and
stuff like that the allegations in the district were far from the truth they
weren't true at all and another fact that he heard the district before it went out further just
put me in a dark place how can you disprove an allegation simply by saying it's not true when
there is evidence I'll explain more about this point near the end of the video balls go through my head I
couldn't explain because I have done nothing but support my brother
everything this isn't true you've ridiculed me several times over the
years especially during the time I got banned at Eurogamer I mean that's not supportive at all even tweets like this
are ridiculous brothers meant to stick by you no matter what have your back no
matter what no matter what so you go on and Logan pools podcast when I asked you
not to is you having my back no matter what making a diss track on me is you
having my back no matter what I mean you literally reacted to Quebecers diss track and said this you know what's
funny I like a recorder insecure is like you can JJ I'm so sorry you're angry hairline so
[ __ ] up your barber is oh because my
man has a big full head oh okay keep that hidden you so scared why would
you hide anymore is that your girlfriend oh he is hiding his girlfriend
all right lion he is sweet face JJ is hiding his girlfriend I am actually impressed I was not expecting flames
maybe you could teach TJ one or two things this is from his brother my fam
seriously how are you gonna have a go at me not being neutral and then you go and do this I mean clearly you don't
practice what you preach saying that family should always have your back no matter what now
in my district on my brain everything is known fact everything I say in the
district is known facts I don't spill any secrets nothing everything is known fact
well I've disproved the majority of what you've said so now what you can't say everything in the district was known
fact when there are things that are just not true for example this is a lie I've
never fought to go in a caravan why are you making false claims about me where is your evidence it's my parents wine
get rid of me this was also a lie I didn't want to get rid of you I wanted to talk to mom and dad without you there
because I know how much you can manipulate them when you're there I mean surely I'm allowed to talk to my parents
privately without you having to be there also this wasn't a known fact at all how
would anyone else other than me and you know this you're the one that made it no
how is this a known fact this is literally your opinion you even fed lies
to your friends in your district maybe for teknostart but you're on your fourth for [ __ ] this isn't known or
fact I never baited Deji out for texting those girls at any point in time not
once did I mention those tanks it was entirely in Randall's dish and the fact that he said that I'm on my
for for portion it's not only untrue it is extremely disrespectful and you can't
deny that you didn't tell JLo because you said on Logan Paul's podcast I'm one
of our abortions yeah yeah I'm on about bosoms yeah what about abortions so um he's
like well your boy right there said before whoa later lyric in the song is fourth abortion he's had like pregnancy
skills scares are bit like how we cannot produce these guys like you actually had
to go pregnant to the point that that you know they have to go to a clinic four times wow it's bright man it's
Laura is that true dog cuz that that lines kind of a yeah yeah that's heavy
yeah hate to see that none of this will be out in the public without you exposing it in the district so you
really can't say that your district is based on known facts well my district my brother gave me
permission to upload it permission was given he said you cannot blow the
district upon me uploading like this track of my brother look and Paul invited me to his podcast so what what
made you comfortable coming on impassive today because my beef isn't really with you and I guess I did have beef with
Jake but it was mainly just to sell the fight that was the main reason so like it's not I know he said when on the
Shane Dawson think that he wanted to kill me and stuff he did yeah he said
it's because I just felt betrayed I felt hurt and in all honesty I was just tired
of doing anything my brother wanted me to do okay so this is the issue with you
you're not consistent with how you act towards me I was so reluctant in saying
that it was okay for you to put up the diss track but I let it slide because I knew it would help your channel but
going on Logan Paul's podcast I told you I didn't want you to go on it and you can't say that online because here's the
text between us
how do you think it made me feel to see my own brother openly discuss our issues
with the one guy I hate that is completely different to a dis tract which I knew would help your channel but
getting Logan involved and going on his podcast had no other purpose than to
betray me not once have I done something like that to you I mean how is that
justified by me staying neutral when you had beef with Randall I'm sorry dizzy
but you can't just pick and choose when you want to listen to my opinion on a
situation that suits you and then expect me to be okay with it so I went on loading Paul's podcasts I saw as a way
to just branch out from my bro I honestly did so you thought go on and
look on Paul's podcast to talk about me was the best way to branch out for my
bro we went on there to talk about something else than fine but you didn't it was all pretty much about me the best
way H to branch out from me is to not talk about me at all
and then on top of that make good quality content that your fans would
enjoy does he have a god complex is it that's what I mean like his ego is ya insane he's like here is distract to
cadet er he compared himself to Ares yo when he when he did the thing with review he said oh my god
like I don't I don't I actually think he thinks he's a god what's going on what's going on with him now getting back to I
think all of that I don't know that's like that's like not me and all of that I have no clue in mashed potatoes and
banging strippers and what is he doing doing does it have anything to do with
the bandana
it's just a big forehead behind it that's it right there is like is he's a receding hair why doesn't he get a
little less forehead he's got money well none of these points were about the diss track these were all unrelated digs
towards me so yet again you're not being accurate with your claims considering I
helped out my brother will this channel a lot by a series that my brother currently
does called one question go when I saw my brother I showed I showed him a video
where a guy got his fans to just ask him questions on discord and I told him that
he should do something similar to that and no credit was given to me when he
when he did the video he didn't give me any credit at all well dizzy I'm sorry I'm sorry I didn't give you credit for
advising me on doing a video that we both saw but wouldn't you agree that me
doing a one question go video on your channel did way more for you than if I
just given you a 10 second shower on one of my one question girl videos financially and viewership wise plus I
giving you advice on several videos like that I nearly got shot video or us doing
Jarosz on fortnight and I got no credit for that but the difference is I don't care I don't feel the need to have
credit when I'm just helping out my brother so the situation of me keeping my brother out on Christmas has been taken
out of context incredibly so my brother and I when I was in LA we agreed to talk
but my brother he didn't come to talk he came to fight instead of coming to talk
he threatened to smash my computer and he was acting irate he was just acting
so erratic it was I couldn't explain it upon threatening to smash my computer I
locked myself in my office just so he couldn't do sir and little did I know
this whole situation my brother was recording the whole situation which further shows my brother's manipulation
considering he asked to talk we agreed to talk and he came for a fight as I
lost myself in my office he did he threatened to smash the door saying he
will smash the door down obviously my parents stopping him for the safety of my parents and due to his behavior I
asked him if he could just if he could leave my house or I'll call the police
which he recorded and took out of context completely so he
tweeted this out the the voice message of me saying leave my house or I'll call
the police he tweeted that out causing fans to just turn on me they turned on
me not knowing the situation or why I told him why I told him to leave my
house the fans turned on me further showing how we just manipulated the
situation
you
[Music]
initially when I went to see the family on Christmas Day I came to talk
I came to reason I came to fix the situation I came to understand why my
brother was so angry at me to the point of him making a dish strike on me and
then when I went my brother my mom my dad pretty much said it was all my fault
so losing control and that is why I
tweeted that it's always my fault that's how I was made to feel by my
family it was not me trying to manipulate the situation at all I also
wanted my brother to remove the dish because I felt like in order for us to essentially move on the video had to go
and he refused so I got upset and I said I would smash his computer and
I should have friend him but I was just so annoyed and then that's when he locked himself in his room where the
computer was and then I said I would smash the door down if he doesn't come
out to talk again I was completely out of line but I'm sorry I was just uh I was just so frustrated man I just wanted
to talk as a family to resolve the issue privately so then eventually he told me
to leave and I did I came to the house to reason but he just wasn't prepared to do so and that's why I tweeted and
posted the the audio clip also my brother said I was manipulating the situation by recording our conversations
during Christmas Day but he did exactly the same thing further things happen
when I asked my brother to leave my house but I'm not gonna mention that I'm
not gonna mention that in this video I have no idea what he's talking about here nothing else happened when I left
as you heard in the recording died he used in this video I just accepted the situation was a lost cause and left I
drove back to my house on Christmas Day and that was it he started playing victim on social media saying I kicked
him out on Christmas for no reason whereas there was a huge reason he was
he was he didn't come here to talk frightened like brother to brother he
came here to fight me Reggie I I never said you kicked me out for no reason we
both got annoyed at each other that day you didn't want to talk it through or listen to my perspective you were
persistent in blaming me for Randolph dissing you and you said the whole
situation was essentially my fault honestly the beef between you and Randolph had nothing to do with me you
just dragged me into it I mean he said he wanted to talk yeah he was recording the whole situation with which is just
like I said it shows manipulation so I too was recording the situation
I only started recording when I locked myself in my room in my office because
he wasn't acting like he wanted to talk he was acting like he wanted to fight me I wasn't trying to fight you at all I
never laid a finger on you this caused us to have a back-and-forth on Twitter but of course as he has more
followers as he had as he was playing victim people were just ignoring me
they weren't take they were just saying that I was lying that they anything I
said just didn't matter the amount of followers or fans
someone has doesn't determine whether they're right or wrong you recorded the
whole conversation as well you could have shown how out of context my voice
memo was but you did it this caused me to get hates of all social medias I
started to lose subscribers fans and I
even starts again for so if maybe life was better off without me if I was
honest I I was just saying what was what
was the point Deji I I never ever ever ever ever ever want you to have thoughts like that I
never want you to feel like that at all and it pains me it pains me that you've
felt like that because of a disagreement between us you should always know you
could talk to me especially if you're having dark thoughts or just feeling low
I'm always here for you whether we're on good times or bad terms whenever you message me I always replied
edge I want you to succeed in everything you do but dead you man you have to
communicate with me how or how else am I going to know how you're feeling
and this isn't just directed at Deji if any of you watching this have thoughts
like this then you should 100% know that someone [ __ ] cares for you
and loves you you you should never feel alone and yeah that's why I'm giving all
the money made on this video to suicide prevention charities because suicide
should never should never be the answer
if I'm honest I've always been alone in this YouTube scene I've always been a
lone wolf who the only people who really done videos with are in my family my
brother and my parents that's that's just not true Deji you've done videos
with many other youtubers Marcus Butler the raka raka twins dax crypt jello and
many many many women there are loads of youtubers who would love to do videos
with you you 100% definitely not alone in this youtube Seend edge this further
caused me to get hate and i asked my brother if he could stop trash-talking
me in videos where his only responsibles for me to delete the district but then going back to my brothers texts at the
end of the day it's just a diss track it isn't just a diss track though it's a
diss track at your own brother this is just completely different man you're publicly backstabbing your own
brother this isn't just a youtube feud anymore it's a family one now my brother laughed at the situation and reacted to
the district reacted to my video still on him and was just making fun of the
situation so the little respect I had I
took it and I reverted the diss track wedgie I'm sorry ok this was extremely insensitive but
like I said in the beginning of this video me laughing at the situation helped me get through it last December hands down
man the worst month of them of my life man if you arks anyone around me how I was
feeling during December they would all tell you that I was miserable I hated that month and I never ever want
to relive it again you weren't the only one that was affected the district had been made private and I then told my
brother to stop trash-talking me in videos which he did not stop he carried
on trash-talking me in videos even after I put the district down dead there is no
evidence of you telling me to stop trash-talking you please show me you telling me to stop trash-talking you
after you pirated the music video quite frankly it it never happened besides I
never even trash talk to you I literally was just laughing at memes I was
literally laughing it means that were created by you coming at me for no reason like I said I'd rather laugh than
cry and it's not like I was even encouraging it I literally told my audience to stop making them so a
recurring thing that I found out about my brother is that he tends to attack people when they're down so for instance
Joella after being him in this in the whole fight he still continued to bash
him for no reason all right let's see how much well as improved holy crap yes
you punched oh my god he's improved Wow did you attacked Joella as well
literally three months after I fought it
was like he's been smash the bracelet all right the home base for this let me
see them another example is net nobody
when it's going through a whole custody battle for his son against this baby mama while he was having beef with JJ JJ
decided I'll let me get his baby mama in my district which obviously I town he
would be okay with there's no way in hell we tends to the tapi pool when
they're at their lowest point if you for him so terrible why did you act like this when you were reacting to my dish
[Music]
[Music] tends to attack people when they're at
their lowest points which is something I want to plow up there and to those two I
want to say I'm sorry for playing party to it [ __ ] you've done the exact same thing though you can't just change your
tune to fit your argument and make me look like the bad guy also how is this
you defending yourself you literally just said I'm just putting this out there and you're attacking me now my
brother also uses subliminal messaging against me for example he'll say that he
wants his second channel to take over my main channel to which his fans will try
and accomplish considering he as a mutt he's much bigger than me much bigger
than me like she sees everything as a competition between us whereas I don't I
don't have competition with family but it seems like he he does I'll admit I am
a competitive person that is why I am in the position I'm in today to put it
quite simply I do not like to lose I'm sorry but I don't see how you can get anywhere without being at least a little
bit competitive so yeah I don't understand why this is a bad thing to have this is what makes me want to be
successful and even within family sibling rivalry is toe a normal thing we're in a competitive
industry we have to do what we can to stay on top you she was a huge platform yeah he wants to overtake my channel
which will result in me losing subscribers for his game vej listen I
this is gonna be a revelation for you why do you care so much if I overtake you in subs do you know why you care so
much it's because you're competitive I mean realistically it's not even that deep
I've lost millions of subscribers in my time I now news this subscribers right now but you still don't see me
complaining in my whole youtubing career I have lost seven point six million
subscribers Dage come on man eight that deed so he would say something and then
end it with I'm joking whereas he's not joking he's serious about the message
whereas people will obviously take this as him being serious it's just that I'm
joking is just a defense mechanism
Neji I'm kidding it's a joke it's a joke ditch this is all the joke please do not
make a video about me please do not go in on me please don't play me or the victim please Digi
this is just banter this is just friendly competition that is all okay just some fun bravo rivalry that another
piece of subliminal messaging my brother does is he shows him unsubscribing from
my channel in a video which will result in his fans also unsubscribing from my
channel so from all of this it's clear
that you do care about subscribers otherwise you wouldn't bring it up God knows why because you literally don't
get paid from subscribers pretty much just a number these days people unsubscribe from you because I did and
clearly they weren't fans in the first place or maybe they are fans and they're just trolling but ditch who cares
end of the day it's your content that makes people interested in you put up bad content eventually people
aren't gonna care about it anymore subscribers don't affect your livelihood did it affects your ego and that's just
it he also told his fans to tweet me to delete my channel but on Twitter
not my YouTube channel because that would give me views to his channel because I'll get the views I'd say just
tweet him tweet him saying delete your channel but obviously his fans still wrote this on my channel as well he's
basically using his fans to attack me also known as mob mentality another
piece of subliminal messaging that my brother uses is him saying that I'm just
trying to reach ten million subs that I betrayed him just to try and reach ten
million subs which is far from the truth considering I if anybody knows me they
know I don't focus on numbers I didn't even know how to look at analytics
you're massively contradicting yourself as I've just said it's clear that you do
care about the numbers why would you even make a video faking getting a diamond play button if you don't care
about the numbers you even said this in the video I've been stuck on nine point seven million subscribers for the
longest time on this channel every six months or so and that doesn't care about numbers and subscribers you seem very
aware of the fact that you have been on nine point seven million subscribers for
six months I've never even done two million three million four or five going
someone's special I've never done a milestone video special the only one
I've ever done is 1 million 1 million subscribers what even is this sentence
that's like saying you've never ever punched anyone in the face besides that one time you punch someone in the face
ultimately you still punch someone in the face so you can't say you've never made a subscriber milestone video
because you have anyway it's clear that you do care about numbers even pointless numbers like subscribers
there's no point claiming you don't when everything you're saying shows that you do care so just say that you can just be
honest how can I blame him for caring about numbers when I used to do the exact same thing I used to be obsessed with how
many subscribers I had how many followers I had on Instagram how many views I got on my videos etc I was
always focused on finding ways to increase my numbers to the point where I was doing videos that I just wasn't
passionate about but I did it because I knew it would get me the views I wasn't making videos for me anymore and that's
why I left in 2017 yeah I just wasn't happy at all so after my break I made
sure I never focused on numbers ever again and instead did everything for me
if I'm passionate about something then people will see that and enjoy the
content with me I mean there's enough people in the world someone's gonna enjoy something you enjoy doing but yeah
I know we live in a society where everyone just focuses on numbers these days man so sometimes it's good to just
step back and you know just don't worry about that he unfollowed me on all
social media platforms but I never unfollowed him so what he did he blocked me on Instagram and then unblocked me
just to make it look like I unfollowed him when he unfollowed me when I followed him back if you understand what
I mean as people got a notification that I followed him which also shows signs of manipulation edge I got annoyed when you
uploaded that this strike that's why I impulse Lee unfollowed you it's got
nothing to do with manipulation I've always been scared to stand up to my brother considering he has more social
power social media power than me like he has more social media friends than I do
so I've always just been very scared to stand up for myself well you weren't
afraid to stand up for yourself when you made the whole district on me even told me in front of our parents to stop
talking to his YouTube friends which is one reason why you don't really see me
doing collaborations with other youtubers like I said earlier in the video you have done videos of other
youtubers and edge I never told you to stop talking to my friends why why would
I say now you can make videos with any of my friends why I stopped how can I stop you every
youtuber wants to do a video with you then they're gonna do a video with you also that you've gotta remember that
it's not just a one-way street you can't just expect people to ask you to do collabs you sometimes have to reach out
for yourself because you know where's
the door this is just two robbers fine
I'm not bringing you down I was just annoyed that you that you didn't want to
play the scary game also you literally called me dumb as well and I even apologized at the end so we could just
continue with the video we're not gonna just agree on everything we do we're gonna clash and have arguments so why
does that make me a bad person I couldn't learn it because I me personally I just I didn't like it I
didn't might be I didn't like the way he was talking to me I didn't like the way he treated me or anything I just I just
couldn't upload it I just I just don't like being belittled I mean you're doing the exact same thing to me in this video
and you don't see me complaining I swear
I looked I saw I looked everywhere
there's no one there so bad even some of my fans have realized that my brother doesn't he doesn't it doesn't
look like he wants to do videos with me just from his body language it makes it look like he just feels forced to be in
videos with me there's you're not the only one I do this for I do this on other people's channels as well he's
saying anything that seems familiar um any I guess it could be down here I
have no idea mmm it also sang with an intro video that's
just how I am did sometimes I'm just not in the mood sometimes I'm just tired sometimes I just can't be bothered you
know I'm not fake I'm not gonna pretend that I have energy 100 percent of the time or I'm not gonna pretend I'm
excited all the time about everything that I do I'm just gonna be me if I'm just air slumps like this like I'm still
doing the video I I mean I don't know how this is the point really cuz yeah that's that's just me man
my brother is acting like he has not done anything anything wrong in this whole situation
when he goes on podcast or anything he just acts like he's the victim in the
whole situation he just acts like I did everything everything is my fault and
that really pains me because that makes the fans think that I'm the bad guy
I'm the one who started all this ya know I'm just old enough is that is it
literally like no no I don't care I won't follow them I you know I don't
care anymore he's these ladies bird now you can rest in it just makes me believe me he's just
so far gone in his own ego for him to not realize what he's doing that I'm not
saying I'm a victim I'm just saying the truth I'm not trying to manipulate the
situation I just want this to be over and done with I want my point of view to be expressed
as much as you want yours I mean I've been trying to keep this as private as possible
and that's why I haven't really said much on the whole matter but now it's clear to me from your video that you are
upset with the whole situation and that's why I want to make things right that's why I'm making this video I'll
admit I need to work on being closer with mom and dad and that's why recently
I've you know come to the house more often I also hate you up for us to do videos together because I was trying to
help improve things on your channel I've also tried to communicate with you more as well so you know I'm actively trying
to make things better but obviously you just want me to say this publicly so
that is why I'm doing this video and that's why I'm responding to you my
brother thinks he knows me but he really doesn't know anything about me
he doesn't even know much about my parents I have never said I know you in fact I definitely do not know you nor
do you know me and that's why we need to work on this relationship as a family he doesn't even know my parents birthdays
my dad had to remind my brother of when my mom's birthday was my dad had to Rome
might literally remind him on the day that it's you know our mom's birthday
she's just sad honestly it's sad I'm sorry dizzy but people forget I was
really busy at the time I was in Dubai I was supporting Fordow of his fight and
it's not like I left it for like a week I literally woke up in the middle of the night and messaged my mom instantly yes
I forgot but it doesn't mean that I don't care I sent her a message as soon as my dad reminded me my mom's birthday
is made the fourth our dad's birthday is August 28th and your birthday is
December the 9th people forget nitch I'm sorry Irene said happy birthday to you
last year and you never replied by the way how is this you defending yourself
our parents is birthday have nothing to do with us not knowing each other at this point you're literally just
attacking me you're trying to make me look as bad as possible you're trying to make it look like I don't care about the
family I thought the intention of your video was to defend yourself not attack me I was bringing up that I was
late to wish my mom a happy birthday defending yourself how is it anything to
do with you at all my brother even called my dad saying that he was going to destroy my channel and then after
that call these are the texts that proceeded after him saying that if my
dad recorded the call that he would copyright strike the video and his and
it's very sad that my brother assumes that my dad would do something disgusting like that [ __ ] if I had said
that it would have been in the heat of the moment I know I impulsively say things that I don't mean when I get
angry or upset it's something I'm definitely working on it I do not want
your channel to be destroyed I want us both to succeed people will take this
the wrong way and see this as an attack but this is literally just me sticking up for myself for years I've been
suppressed but me making this video I don't want any negativity towards my brother from what you've heard in this
video please I did not make this video for my brother to get hate or any negativity I simply made this video
because I have to stick up for myself I'm tired of people see me as the bad guy or they don't know the full
situation edge you knew perfectly well that you making this video would get me
hate otherwise you will have approached me privately in the description you even said that you don't want to be seen as
the bad guy anymore so do you want me to be seen as the bad guy now there's there's no bad guys or
good guys in this whole situation we both made mistakes and I know even
though I don't want it that you might get a bit of hate from this video unfortunately this is a byproduct of us
doing this publicly it's something that we just have to live with and accept anyway I'll say this again I think it's
best for us to do this privately man all right and that's the first video done so
in preparing for this video my brother uploaded it's another video in anticipation of my reply a to be honest
I can only see this as an attempt to damage control but yeah I guess how to
go through this second video as well now and defend myself yet again so let's do
this as tweets after I uploaded my video further shows his immaturity towards the
situation here are some of his tweets
it's actually sickening when I look at it because this is a serious situation
and he's treating it like a joke so that all of these tweets were made before I even watched your video I know it was
wrong of me to judge the video before even watching it but I saw the description and I saw the thumbnail and
the title and I was like ah here we go again is another video of him going at me that's why I tweeted the meme and
showed my audience that I did not want to go through why I went through again in December and then once I watched the
video I knew I had to respond and take this seriously so I'm sorry for not
initially initially initially oh my god initially I'm sorry for not initially
taking this seriously he even sent me a text saying congratulations completely missing the
whole point of my video well ditch I'm not gonna lie this is truly how I feel the timing of your video just doesn't
look good on your part and you have to admit this so you just happen to feel like this a week after the whole James
Charles Sharma where it also started with a 14 minute exposing video that blew up massively
you just happen to bring this all out at a time when you were losing subscribers and your views were down and don't even
try and say that you don't care about subscribers or numbers because we've already established that you clearly do
I mean did you can't deny the similarities and the timings everyone knows how badly you want to hit 10
million subscribers to the point of view even freaking getting the 10 million
subscriber Platt yeah if this is how you wanna do it then I guess fine what really upset me it's not that my
brother's gonna be responding is that my brother is trying to dig up dirt in his
response towards me he tweeted out you know if anybody has any stories with me
to damn him and if it's just it said that he's now
going that path he's going the path of destruction all right so let me explain
this tweet yes I was annoyed yes initially I wanted to highlight some of
the allegations that I have heard against you regarding women I wanted to
bring them to your attention to make you realize that what you've been doing is wrong I'm sorry about it was just
frustrating that in your video you were claiming that you had done nothing wrong
and that all of the allegations were just false but with so many women coming forward with similar stories these
allegations don't look so false to me to be honest and too earnest your second
video just adds to the credibility of these women why would you make your video to defend yourself when you don't
even know what I'm going to say why would you go so far as to threaten me with legal action when you don't even
know what the allegations are if you didn't think that there was some truth in them then you wouldn't have anything
to worry about but because they're just allegations I'm not going to publicly address instead I'm gonna privately send you the
stories that these women have come forward with I hope that you do the right thing in first acknowledging that
you have in the past made several women feel uncomfortable as well as feel
manipulated and then secondly apologizing to these women and any other woman for that matter the whole video
was literally not an attack I did not lie at all in the whole video well we
all know now how long true this is I even have a conversation a DM conversation that my brother had with a
fan who's obviously conversed with me in the past I just just look for yourself
you
this isn't about me trying to destroy this is about you learning to take
responsibility over your actions you need to own up to your mistakes and apologize and not just the ones you've
been caught up on I mean your video was supposedly about making me realize what I've done wrong well I'm gonna make you
realize what you've done wrong so I have the screenshots of you talking to her on
Facebook the only reason I messaged her was to make sure at the screenshots were real now I know that they are either way
I'm not going to share anything publicly because that's just not fair on her but yeah you just you just need own up and
apologized edge how works herself and I don't want your brother to know I messaged you either because he doesn't
seem like a very nice person but when I told him no he was so like desperate and
somewhat manipulative trying to get me to send screenshots and that's her words herself
I did not Co herself to say any of this these are her words so she explicitly says I don't want your
mother to know that I messaged you so what do you do you post a public video about it and now I know that she
messaged you how is this fair on her you know how you know her you know the first
conversation you had with her you know and I know what was said do the right thing
own up to your mistakes and apologize with my brother putting that tweet out
you're definitely gonna get people who are going to lie about the situation just to make me look a lot worse a lot
worse you don't think I didn't think of that I definitely got a lot of crap from that tweet but I also got a lot of women
with real experiences with you whip screenshots I wasn't interested in
talking to the girls unless they had some sort of evidence to back their story other girls have messaged me as well
sharing me their games with my brother I'm not gonna show those themes as this video is not an attack on my brother go
ahead go ahead show all the d-ends like I I have literally nothing to hide with
my brother's video if he does mention any lies or any form of just
manipulation or anything from the DMS that he's gonna get I won't before
to take legal action I would much rather not do that but I would be forced to
take legal action for defamation of character like I said before this is just an extreme action to take against
claims that are supposedly not true I didn't mean to take me in a call over the anticipation of allegation just
screams guilty besides how you gonna take me to court when there's proof I have evidence you can't sue me for
defamation of character if it's true you're not even defending yourself anymore you're just threatening
me now what he needs to do is just take responsibility that's it he's older than
me just take responsibility I said he's going to attack me
I haven't attacked you at all in this video deck I've simply responded and defended myself from everything you have
said in your video I have taken responsibility and now you need to do the same upon me uploading my video as
well my brother has started to distance himself from my parents to make them feel guilty for getting involved and
preventing my brother destroying my livelihood and destroying my credibility I'm not gonna explain what he's doing
but that's what that's the level he's going you're exaggerating this so far
beyond from what it actually is let me explain what I'm doing our parents currently deal with our
finances even before this whole situation blew what I had started to feel like this wasn't such a good idea
anymore stuff like this where family always gets complicated and to be honest I just wanted my parents to be my parents again
and not just accountants and then with the past few months it's just highlight
I definitely do not want my parents to be in charge of my finances I mean our
mom went into my private accounts to give my brother false information to use
in a district that was public I mean that alone is just it's just crazy and I
just feel like I just need more control I mean I'm definitely not distancing myself in an attempt to make them feel
guilty I mean why would you even suggest I mean come on this literally has
nothing to do with you you're literally trying to manipulate everyone in making me look
like I'm going out of my way to hurt my parents when you know nothing about the
situation all I'm doing is protecting myself I my finances from being burnt in the future and that's it I'm still gonna
talk to my parents I'm still gonna visit our parents I'm still gonna do activities with our parents I'm just
removing the financial side I just want to remove any potential complications that come with it and just focus on
being a family I know our family is going through a lot because of tank and that's why I also want to remove the
hassle of doing my finances during this period but my brother once is he wants
my parents to pick science that's what he wants you know what I want [ __ ] I want you to stop saying my parents and
instead say our parents because I am part of this family too you have made me an outcast throughout
all of this you talk to any of our friends and ask them who has caused the most hassle all of them will say you you
have literally made my life a living hell and all for what views subscribers you always say that family comes first
but that's not true is it huh to you to
you the fans come first I've made so many attempts to try and fix our family issues I've even suggested that we go
see a therapist but you just refused I'm
just so tired of fighting a losing battle with my own family man I'm tired
of feeling like an outcast yes I can do better but so can you man like I'm at
the point where I can't even take take my own girlfriend to see my family
because I'm scared that she's gonna get exposed and my brother is gonna use that
information against me I'm scared to even text my family because I'm scared
you're gonna just screenshot the [ __ ] message and just post it publicly and
I'm scared to even call my family because I'm scared you're gonna just take one negative thing that I say
manipulate the audience and just make me look as bad as possible I'm just sick
and [ __ ] tired of it like I shouldn't
have to feel like this I even have these concerns it's it's stop it's so ridiculous man and you can't
expect me to just fix everything by myself we need to do this as a family we
need to resolve all of our issues as a family I've never been so happy honestly
I've never been so happy just going on social media and just seeing all the all
the disappoint that you guys have given me I want to say thank you so much
honestly I thank you so much so all the people who sent me a tweet
sent me a DM messaged me on any social media that I have I wanted to say thank
you thank you I really do appreciate it I really do this is the happiest you've
ever been gaining subscribers at the expense of dragging your own brother makes you your happiest airing all of
our issues publicly makes you your happiest this type of video shouldn't
make you happy at all it should do the complete opposite you should have told me privately how you've been feeling for
me this response video doesn't make me happy at all it makes me physically sick this past
week I've been on tour but the only thing that's been on my mind is your video man I am sick and tired of this
whole [ __ ] situation I just want it to [ __ ] end man none of this should
have been made public either way I'm going to work on trying to resolve all
of this I love my family regardless of what I've been put through or what I put
DG through I'm gonna work this out I didn't want to reply to this publicly but you know I had to defend myself
just like you didn't move your video I just want I
just want this to be over man I just want this to be over and done with so
please can let's just be done with this stage and yeah man I'll always love you
yeah
