0,FineBros,YouTube,2016,Fine Bros apology (REUPLOAD),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoLSOba3_UE&t=4s,hey everybody this video is US wanting to explain some things about react World the confusion and negative response over what this all is has been so overwhelming and what we've realized is that we completely screwed up with how we originally talked about this first and foremost we're sorry for confusing people by using terminology like our react format we were never trying to say that every video or someone reacts to something else is something we would try to control when we referenced licensing the react format we only meant our specific series not the overall genre of reaction videos we do not own the genre and we're creators at heart and those who know us personally know how passionate we are about trying to help creators and react World is meant to be an extension of that with us simply providing resources and tools to anyone who wants to go down this path of creating one of our series with direct support from us so there's no way to go into all of the questions that people have about this but we're going to answer some of the biggest ones that we've seen Okay so first is what exactly constitutes any of your series formats and the simple answer is watch any of our series that is part of the react World license and that is the exact format it's not one or two elements it's all of the elements of the show all used in the same style and way we've been trying to find an analogy to explain this better and we know that this isn't the best but if you wanted to start a fast food restaurant you can start one on your own and possibly find huge success but if you love Burger King and want to be part of that organization if you join you'd be able to get access to things like menu items and recipes and specific logos and promotional support and these are two totally different routes same kind of thing here with react World you can join and get all these assets and support or you can make your own reaction videos completely without us it's up to you okay so another question is have you applied for any trademarks yes we have trademarks just like other companies that use trademarks to protect their properties so for example we have a YouTube channel youtube.com/ react so we're trying to protect it and not run the risk of losing our channel name thanks to someone else getting the trademark but just because we have or might get trademarks doesn't mean we're going to run around and start taking down videos and the last thing we're going to talk about is if there has ever been a situation where we had to take down someone's video yes and look when you create series and products sometimes there is specific situations where your content is being infringed like if someone freeb booots a video on Facebook or in very rare cases if someone produces a beat bybe version of your exact series which has happened to us but again with this one and all of these it's very very complex and we also know that there's so many more questions that you guys have and we want to do our best to answer as many of them as possible so we've set up an email that we will be personally checking if you want more clarification so please write us at ask the Fine Bros at gmail.com for our viewers who are not really part of this conversation and just here to watch our videos thanks for sticking with us through this and for everyone else we want to continue the conversation but either way we just wanted to thank everyone for hearing us out,On,Repost

3,James Charles,YouTube,2019,James Charles Tati re-upload,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3Ukl4l_LM8,Oh James here um I'm currently traveling abroad and just woke up but I wanted to sit down and make a video addressing all everything that's going on right now because they've over memory I owe everybody an explanation but most importantly I owe two important people an apology to tatiane James Westbrook I'm sorry for everything that is going on everything that I have put you through over the past few weeks I met Tati and James almost three years ago now but I was first coming into the industry and when I had no friends and nobody to talk to or look up to and Tati very quickly took on a parental role with me because she knew my parents were across the country and over the past few years of knowing her family her husband have given me so much love and advice and opportunities and a place to stay and a shoulder to cry on at in the morning and support when nobody else would or wanted to and it and I'm so disappointed in myself that I ruined our relationship with that did mean so much to me even if I didn't to the best job of shutting it all the time and throughout all of this what sucks the most is that I know there's nothing I can say or do to ever earn that friendship or trust back but I don't blame them for it a lot of my most of my career over the past few years has been about me making mistakes and trying to learn and grow from them and I haven't always done the best job of that I can admit that but I have always tried because I know there's a lot of people watching me and that a lot of people look up to me as a role model and I hate knowing that I disappointed not only them but most importantly to people that have been role models to me doing this I wish that I could say this is the last time that I would make a mistake but it won't be I know that'll disappoint people more and more as I continue to learn and grow every single day I have a long way to go very a long way to go but that's okay um I'm gonna keep trying my best and keep learning and growing and be the best version of me that I possibly can be I'm sorry for that in regards to the Coachella situation with the brand deal on the security guard I've already told my truth about this twice and instead of talking about it for a third time and explaining it and going into detail and pulling up receipts it doesn't matter and I'm I understand that no matter what I say or do they're always going to be people that don't believe me and will think that I'm lying that's okay at this point the truth really does not matter it's the feelings that do and no matter what happened I heard two very very important people and they've been really really loyal to me and I betrayed that know sucks and I wish more than anything that I could take it back in regards to the boy situation I've been involved a lot of very unique and strange situations that have left people confused or upset and I've learned the hard way about ways that I can interact with boys that I'm interested in and also ones that I should or shouldn't be talking to this is a conversation that I know a lot of people are uncomfortable with and it's something that I should have been far more careful with bringing into the public eye especially with the lot of situation that just happened I've had to learn it the hard way but coincidentally enough Tati really was one of the people to sit me down and tell me how it looked from the outside and let me know hey talking to these boys might get you in trouble one day and she was right in regards to my own mother well I know you want to defend me and fight for me and go off on comments but I ask that you don't this is my problem that I got myself into and this is my job to deal with this no matter what is anybody is saying or commenting or talking about mom I need you to know that you're the most important person in my life and think you're an amazing mother and I don't know what I would do without you and I'm so grateful for everything that you've done for me and the lessons that you have taught me and that everything that you continue to do for me and my brother and I need you to know that I need you to know that and the same thing goes for Tati as well who is an amazing person and truly does want the best for everybody around her I'm so disappointed to myself that I her um a lot of times when I've had to address things in the past I've acted out of impulse and I've gone off and tried to pull receipts or facts or screenshots and play the victim and I'm not doing that today No that is I have to say I'm sorry,On,Repost
4,Jenna Marbles,YouTube,2020,Jenna Marbles Apology,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=679d-SQfWLk,all right so I get it feel like we're at a time where we are purging ourselves of anything and everything toxic and I'm being requested that I address things that I've done in my past I also get a lot of tweets from people that are saying like we love you you unproblematic Queen which always makes me uncomfortable because I'm a person those of you that are familiar with how long I've been on the internet know that that's not true that I've definitely done things in the past that weren't great and I'm not completely unproblematic and I've tried my best to grow up and to be a better person and first and foremost I want everyone to know that I've always been a two-way street and that anytime that you criticize me and tell me that you would like me to do better or to do something differently that I always try to do that and I try to make fun content inclusive content things that don't offend people or upset people and that's kind of where I am there's a couple things that people want me to address and apologize for and I'm happy to do that because what I want from the people that I support and that I like is to have accountability and to know that I'm supporting someone whose morals and values align with my own and yeah I there's things in my past I'm not proud of and I'm getting a lot of tweets from people saying why have you private adalah zone videos and I have spent a lot of the last few days private e almost all of my old content and I'm sorry if any of that holds any nostalgia for you but I'm literally not trying to put out negative things into the world I think there was a time when having all of my old content exists on the internet showed how much I have grown up as a person which I'm very proud of and I think now it's hard for that content to exist at all because I think people watch it and don't bother to look at when it was posted or you know care about what path I took to get to where I am it offends them now and if that's the case where people will watch something and be offended now I don't want it to exist so I private it a lot of my old content because I just don't want anyone to feel upset about anything I I don't want to contribute to that I don't want I don't care I don't care I just don't care I don't want someone to watch something and feel hurt or offended now for any reason at all the first two things that I would like to address is the fact that there are people that were offended that I did blackface as Nicki Minaj in 2011 and I'll show you the clip credibly crazy and embarrassing this is private it has been private for quite some time but it looks like this and I do just want to tell you that it was not my intention to do blackface this is the end of the video where I took my wig off I I don't know how else to say this but it doesn't matter because all that matters is that people were offended and it hurt them and for that I am so unbelievably sorry that this isn't okay and it hasn't existed on the internet for a long time because it's not okay and I haven't done anything remotely like that because I heard people say this is blackface and I don't like that and I I just would never want to put that into the so this has been private for a long time but I do want to tell you how unbelievably sorry I am if I ever offended you by posting this video or by doing this impression and that that was never my intention it's not okay it's shameful it's awful I wish it wasn't part of my past the next thing that I want to address okay this is also from 2011 a bad year for me in judgment apparently um this video is called bounce that dick this has also been made private I don't want to offend anyone I'm not interested in it I'm not interested in making anyone feel bad in case you haven't noticed here's a clip I won't play it for you hold on let me remind you so as you can see I said hey ching chong Ling Wong shake your King Kong ding dong that was racist I'm bad at rap songs it's awful it doesn't need to exist it's inexcusable it's not okay I'm I'm incredibly sorry if this offended you then now whenever it doesn't need to exist it shouldn't have existed I shouldn't have said that ever it's not cool it's not cute it's not okay and I'm embarrassed that I ever made that period I think say how like to apologize for is a video that I posted in 2012 and made private shortly thereafter this was one of the hardest years of my life and I made video they came across unbelievably slut-shaming and I'm sorry I I just [ __ ] up I ranted about girls that ran around and slept around and that's wrong I had a lot of internalized misogyny I feel like at that time in my life and I'm sorry if I ever offended you with the things that I said in that video that there has been private for a long time it does not reflect my attitude towards anyone in their bodies and I just I that's really been eating me up inside for a long time and I just wanted to tell you that I'm sorry if I ever made you feel bad about yourself or your choices or anything there's no one demanding an apology uh for that video of me right now but I'm like just you know what put it on my tab here's another thing I'm sorry for it I'm also sorry for I used to make a lot of content about like what girls do and what guys do and I know at the time there are a lot of people that enjoyed those videos but I have private adalah cause I don't think that making jokes about your gender is funny and I know that there's a lot of people that struggle with their identity and that have varying fluid identities or anything and I just don't want content in the world that's like I don't know it just doesn't make sense you know it doesn't make sense it can be hurtful can be harmful and I don't want it there another thing I would like to address is when people tweet at me I can't believe you be friends with this person or follow this person that's racist or you know done these terrible things and the only thing I would like to say is that I'm I'm just a person trying to navigate the world the same way that you are so I don't always know what's right what's wrong with the truth is and I'm just trying my best if someone clearly with their own pasts but they're not proud of um I do just try to see people for who they are right now today and that they're not defined by their pasts and I understand I'm trying to do the same thing that you are and support and be friends of people that I'm proud of and that I love and I'm just know that I'm doing my best and I just I don't know you know I try to just do what I can and I'm not trying to let anyone down or hurt anyone or upset anyone I'm just not that being said I've profited a lot of metal content um I don't I don't want to hurt anyone I don't want to offend anyone I don't um case you guys haven't noticed there's no sponsors on this channel not trying to sell you anything like I'm literally just here to have a good time and I don't think I'm having a good time and it seems like maybe some other people aren't having a good time so for now I don't I just can't exist on this channel hopefully I've taken down anything that would upset someone and I hope you know that that's just not my intent that's not what I ever set out to do to hurt anyone's feelings or to make anyone feel bad um so I'm just I don't I don't want to be like upset well I say this so give me a sec so um I think I'm just going to move on from this channel for now um I don't know if that's rubber I don't know how long it's gonna be um I just I want to make sure that the things that I put into the world are not hurting anyone and yeah I'm just gonna stop for now wherever I don't know I'll probably take this video down because it's embarrassing and just let whatever just live and just be that's it I want to say thank you for your support for those of you that um care about me and have been watching me for a long time I appreciate it I want to hold myself accountable and and it's painful to do it and it's not fun at first and I'm ashamed of things I've done and said in my past but it's important and yeah I hope this felt like something that you needed to hear from me and I just I'm not sure that I want to continue doing stuff on this channel and I don't want to put anything out in the world it's gotta hurt anybody so I need to be done with this channel for now or forever I don't know so alright good talk see you

6,Myka Stauffer,YouTube,2020,Myka Stauffer - Update on our family - DELETED VIDEO,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NMkGalhpp0&t=29s,this is by far the hardest video James and I have ever publicly had to make but before I get into the video I did just want to say thank you to how amazing our viewers have been we have some viewers who it just like so incredibly kind and respectful of our son's privacy I just want to say thank you like that where they got me through some really hard times make some face thanks if you have no idea what that means I can't say enough how hard my guys tried throughout this entire journey and the amount of effort she's put into this and helping actually as much as you can so I mean you guys have been part of the dachshund journey even before we would cook Huxley throughout the whole process and you know with international adoption sometimes there's unknowns and things that are not transparent on files and things like that and one plug that came home there was a lot more special needs that we weren't aware of and that we were not told so over the past few years oxygen and numerous therapies to try to help him with all of his needs and over the last year has been a more intense theory that he's been in to try to help them as much as possible with his disappear needs and for us it's been really hard hearing from the medical professionals a lot of their feedback and things that have been upsetting really upsetting for us because every not what we've ever wanted here we've never wanted to be in this position and we've been trying to get them fitted in that and help them much as possible and we truly love there's not an ounce of her fighting over me and it wasn't it I didn't try our hardest and language I was trying to say is that after multiple assessments after multiple valuation numerous medical professionals have felt that he'd a difference in and medical needs he needed more we haven't made this video yet and because we've been trying to protect his privacy his rights and also just try to not mess up his future that was laid out in front of us we're trying our best to make sure we don't impact that at all in making this video and then and that's why I like on Instagram and stuff I kind of like let you know as little as I could but I couldn't tell you any more because you won't mess anything up what's going on legally and if I said something will be gonna something and it has been a really hard place to be is like because you're grieving you I want to share with you guys like I know what you've done inside that I don't have to say anything like I'm not I don't have to say this it'll wash it but I want to like I want to tell you guys I've been there for us for so much and I wanna I want to fill you in on what's going on and what hard like do I feel like a failure as a mom like five hundred percent so when you get like insidious perfil comments it just like really makes our hurt worse it's not about me at all but it's just like this journey has been the last four months have been like the hardest thing I accept that is going to choosing to do because ultimately after pouring are the reason why we can't go into the detail of what actually transpired is because we're totally going to protect Huxley's privacy and not let people know what happened what everything that went on to make us make this decision or to even come to medical professionals with the need to get more help anything that happened in a home day was hard for us that's not fair for me to put out there publicly about his privacy so it's not appropriate like this and I will never be appropriate I didn't go oh boy to share these things publicly every now and then you may have gotten like a teeny like struggle or like a hardship but I was trying to be really raw and real but we haven't intentionally like day one intentionally ninety nine ninety five percent of the struggles we have never publicly aired ever ever with pure intent of respecting his privacy not to give you a fake facade or to be lack of transparency but to respect our son's privacy and this is all that we're okay with sherry the reason we have an updated you sooner because the medical professionals the agencies multiple people have been allowing proudly to spend time with some different people to see and to make the perfect match and fit for his now new forever family from the updates we've gotten from the agency and through the adoption agency like they were able to place him and what they felt was literally the perfect match I'm a bit like a Jimmy's the early oh my god we didn't know a lot of these unknowns and when agencies or adoption agencies have more pieces to the pie or they have more pieces it makes the matching process a little better or else your match and they found somebody that they thought would be ultimately the best fit and he is writing he is very happy he's doing really well and his new mommy has medical professional training and is a very good fit I asked everyone that watch this video that supports our family you know give us grace give us the support and the privacy that we need during this time for ourselves and for actually please just respect his privacy and just know that like we make all my socials like when I for my channel the reason I started my channel is to be positive and to bring people positivity even though we're struggling and when we talk about it's a huge win for us just because I'm a B+ on my story they're having fun doing fun doesn't mean that I'm not like still horribly her vegan the same for Jim so like just please have Grace's us because even though we don't share that publicly we are still struggling I mean we're going to be heartbroken for a very long time so thank you for everything and we just really appreciate all of your support and kindness but just please respect over,On,Repost

morning it's nice to see you dear it's it's nice to be here you were going to be here Friday you basically said you were exhausted you told me you were distraught how are you doing today I was I I it's hard for me to even find the word Matt that I was feeling I was just overwhelmed I I was in a State of Shock still some what yes because uh there's been some very very hurtful lies said about me I I want to get to specifics in a second Paula the the difference between Friday and now is really on the business side of things yes yes uh Food Network let me just say Food Network says no more Smithfield food said they're severing ties with you QVC a big partner of yours is weighing their options do you think you've been treated fairly by your business partners they um let me say this uh before we even get into that the main reason I am here today Matt is it's important to me that I tell you and everyone out there how what I believe and how I live my life I believe that every creature on this Earth every one of God's creatures was created equal no matter who you choose to go to bed at night with no matter what church you go to pray I believe that everyone should be treated equal and that's the way I was raised and that's the way I live my life one of the headlines I read Paula said that there you know it said millions of dollars at stake for Paula Dean in Today's Show interview so are you here to express what you just said or are you here to stop the financial bleeding I am here today because I want people to know who I am and people that have worked beside me have walked beside me know what kind of person I am and I I'm so distressed that people I've never heard of are all of a sudden experts on who I am and you know what distresses me the very most mad and their words are being given weight well they're having an impact Paul let's stay on the business side for a second do you think you've been treated fairly by the companies that have now distanced themselves from you you are a cook but you're also a businesswoman you're the head of a brand you understand the bottom line you understand image yes given the same circumstances would you have fired you would I have fired me knowing me no uh I'm very lucky in this aspect Matt I'm so fortunate that so many of my partners that know who I am have decided to stand by me QVC has not dropped me they say they're weighing their options well there's there's only two that has dropped me and I am so very thankful for the partners that I have that believe in me right now as we sit here it seems to me an informal jury of your peers and your fans and your critics and your business business associates are are weighing the question is Paul ad a racist so I'll ask it to you bluntly are you a racist no no I'm not by birth by choice by osmosis you don't feel you have racist Tendencies no uh as a child I was raised in a home that my father tolerated bad grades he would tolerate maybe me breaking a curfew but he told me he said girl if I ever find out that you have behaved in a way where you think you're better than others or have been unkind your butt is going to be mine all right but you raised your right hand yes I and you swore under oath that you have used a word that is the most offensive word you can use to describe an africanamerican and you've talked about this wedding this wedding you wanted to plan that Plantation style wedding whether you use the n-word or not so how does someone use the n-word whether in anger or in a joke or in private the most offensive word to African-Americans and not be considered a racist yes um the day I use that word it was a world ago it was 30 years ago uh I had had a gun put to my head a shaking gun because the man that had the gun to my head unek knowing to me was my customer at the main office but didn't you also ad call that you used the word on other occasions no so you have other than that one time in the bank a robbery attempt you're telling me you have never used I have never I never they asked me in all of my 66 years on Earth had I ever used it that man was so frightened that day he put the gun to my head because he was a customer at the main office he was later caught and I had gone out on a limb for him and gotten him alone and he was frightened that I was that you were asked in that deposition whether you would use the n-word on other occasions and said probably or of course are in are inaccurate no I answered the question truthfully so you have never used the nword other than that one occasion no it's just not it's just not a part of it's just not a part of who we are let me ask you about this part of the deposition we were asked whether you were asked whether using the n-word in telling a joke was hurtful and you said quote I don't know most jokes are about Jewish people rednecks black folks I didn't make up the jokes they usually Target though a group I can't myself determine what offends another person that last sentence gets me I can't myself determine what offends another person do you have any doubt in your mind that African-Americans are offended by the nword I don't know Matt I have asked myself that so many times because I it's very distressing for me to go into my kitchens and I hear what these young people are calling each other it's very very distressing you never joined in on that language no absolutely not it's very distressing it's very distressing ing for me because I think that for this problem to be worked on that these young people are going to have to take control and start showing respect for each other and not throwing that word at each other that it is it makes my skin crawl I want to read you something that Columbia professor John mcder wrote for Time magazine's website he is by the way African American he wrote people of Dean's generation can neither change the past nor completely Escape their roots in it any more than the rest of us they can apologize and mean it as Dean seems to they also deserve credit for owning up to past sins as Dean did candidly when she could have easily shall we say whitewashed the matter do you ever wish Paula that when you raised your right hand and swore to tell the truth in that deposition that you'd fudged the truth you wouldn't have been the first person who ever lied under oath given Fallout that you've seen over the last week do you ever wish you'd fudge the truth no because uh there's a couple of kinds of people that I don't like that I am prejudiced against Matt and that's thieves and liars and I'll tell you a conversation that I had with my seven-year-old grandson the other day he had spent the night with me and I allowed him to stay up later than his bedtime and I said Jack honey you got Guinea in trouble with Mommy and Daddy when you told them that I had let you stay up late and he was playing with my iPad and he put that iPad down and he looked up at me and he said Kenny I don't tell lies that's how I raised my children that's how I was raised and that's how my grandchildren are being raised and I know as well as I'm sitting here with you I know how I treat people I know my love for people and I'm not going to sit here and tell everything that I have done for people of color I'm not going to do it somebody else can tell that there are a lot of people who've shown up at your restaurant in Savannah to support you lines have grown they've gone to Twitter they've shown their support for you there some have called for a boycott of the Food Network for the way they have de I I don't want that is your salvation in that Core group of fans can you rely on your base and focus to use a political term on that base and survive this um I think that we can never underestimate the power of those Vo voices because these people who have met me and know me and love me they're as angry as the people are that are reading these stories that are lies these people reading the stories that don't know me they don't know they're not lies they have no idea so they are angry and on that same coin the people that know me they're just as angry and uh I have apologized I would never never and I can truthfully say in my life I have never with any intention hurt anybody on purpose and I never would and there's not another side of this personality that we see on TV this this warm sugary sweet even sassy girl of the South there isn't a side of you that is intolerant and perhaps views others as as not equal no no you know I I no what you see is what you get I'm not an actress I'm heartbroken I'm thankful for my part heart broken why heartbroken for yourself or your family heart broken I've had to hold friends in my arms while they've sobbed because they know what's

10,KEEMSTAR,YouTube,"Jun 30, 2016",KEEMSTAR EXPOSED RESPONSE!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJk0aYg2jAA,I have made mistakes I have done things that I regret that I am ashamed of and that I will live with for the rest of my life I deserve to be exposed for these things I deserve to be criticized for these things but over the past few weeks youtubers have been exposing me for things that are simply not true several youtubers have fabricated evidence manipulated footage and outright lied in the hope that people will believe them the worrying thing is people have believed them the hatred for me at this point is so blind the mob mentality so severe that any youtuber can say just about anything and their audience will take it at face value despite the fact that in nearly all cases they provided no evidence no backstory taken things out of context and even gone to the point to outright make things up people still believe it everybody has jumped on an ever-growing bandwagon and I become YouTube's current scapegoat the punching bag for the internet hatred I'm in a position where no matter what I do I receive criticism for I try to defend myself and people say that I'm playing the victim card I go on the attack and people say I'm being childish and overdramatic all I can do is tell the truth and I will tell you everything I will expose the keemstar expose videos I will prove to you that most of the things that have been said about me are false needless to say there are many of these falsehoods so here's how I want to handle it I will play a clip of something someone has claimed to be fact I will then prove that this is not fact by providing genuine evidence and backstory to why it's false in the first place all I ask is that you hear me out after all there are always two sides to every argument and I implore you to give me a chance to explain my side ladies and gentlemen please be seated we are here to review the case of keemstar versus the community to the defence have you prepared a statement yes I have your honor go ahead then the best place to start is a keemstar exposed video that came out around 8 months ago from a youtuber known as Chozen in the video he took several clips from my past out of context and manipulated them into a montage that went on to get the top post on Reddit and get a million views because of it this video became the poster child for many more keemstar exposed videos in fact chosen himself went on to upload pretty much the same video twice and has since created no less than 12 videos dedicated to trying to expose me and I don't think it needs to be said but I'm sure we can all guess why he has made that many I've been laughing for the last hour that your mom died of cancer what I really mean is I hope you get cancer and I hope you [ __ ] live the last [ __ ] month of your life every single day gasping for a breath of air and living with the worst horrible [ __ ] pain of your life this is a fabrication he used a clip to try to convince people that I'm genuinely telling my fans to get cancer that is not true this was a troll a game I created on my livestream literally called [ __ ] the fans where I would come up with the most disgusting things I could think of everybody watching was in on it and understood the game it was a roast of my fans I obviously did not literally want my fans to get cancer this was used out of context to make me look evil and sick and anyone who watched my streams back the can clarify this and to be honest I'm shocked that anyone would believe that this is real it's not like oh you caught me I want them dead the [ __ ] that they said about my kid I want them dead get your recorder ready right now get your recorder ready right now all right are you good are you ready to record those people that said that [ __ ] about my kid I want them dead I want to murder them they provided no backstory to this yes I said it because I was [ __ ] furious and I was [ __ ] furious because the people that I was saying I wanted to kill had just made sexual jokes about my daughter as a parent I was justifiably angry when I said I wanted to kill these people I wasn't going to literally kill them it was an expression of how I was feeling at the time and I make no apologies for saying it I don't really know why so many people have used this clip to make me look like a bad guy we had a disagreement so we had a little pushing match nobody threw fists there was no blood nobody got hurt in any way it was nothing just because you pushed someone once upon a time doesn't make you the son of Satan this argument is ridiculous now I will not attempt to justify that I said the n-word seven years ago I was wrong to say it I make no excuses for the fact that I said it now I could argue that Alex was being racist to me first by calling me a [ __ ] and add a go because I'm Italian and that's why I responded in the way I did at the time but that still doesn't make when I said right I apologize for this the very next day I have apologized for this every year since and I will apologize again to Alex today I am sorry but saying a racist thing in anger seven years ago does not make me a racist I regret it to this day I can't ever take it back I [ __ ] up I omit it but honestly at what point are the people that keep posting this clip over and over again actually in fact being racists them self by using this clip in their little memes and their little parodies and their little jokes aren't these people just as guilty of [ __ ] up as I did back then I'm not saying that everyone who used this clip does this but it's my opinion that there are some people that constantly use this clip who are very [ __ ] hypocritical for even using it in the first place this guy Ryan is a friend of mine and I continue to do business with him to this day in this particular clip I overreacted by saying something that I shouldn't have now apparently I'm being exposed here for telling someone to kill themselves and perhaps it's fair enough however I find it very hypocritical that someone like leafy who has now made two videos exposing me can say this to dozens of people even having his fans say this to me and I turn out to be the only one that gets exposed for it even idubbbz at the end of his keemstar exposed video on ironically told me to kill myself and I've never said this on ironically but I think this would be the first time I actually say and ironically and mean it kill yourself by the way I have very few problems with idubbbz and the video he made about me as I said at the time I genuinely liked it it was made well it was funny now I didn't agree with all of his opinions on me but that's what they were opinions idubbbz didn't fabricate evidence he did not lie they were his opinions and I appreciate them at least to a certain extent because I don't think anyone likes hearing bad things said about them I actually agree with some of the points he brought up I have actually been reflecting on a few of them especially over the last few weeks and while I'd obviously rather the video didn't exist in the first place I don't criticize the video itself and I've got no problem with idubbbz making it at least idubbbz didn't outright lie I'm not gonna alter anything or make anything up right I'm just gonna tell you some stories exactly as they happen this is probably the part of grade-a under AIDS video which angered me the most because he says this at the start and then goes on to fabricate almost everything he says keemstar girlfriend allegedly gone to his twelve while he was out drinking with a friend and started tweeting the tweets were sent from the same location as keemstar which adds proof to the tweets actually being sent from his girlfriend this is a lie my girlfriend was never on my Twitter I was hacked the hacker wrote this stuff to troll me gray tries to desperately provide proof that she did this even when he can't possibly have any he states the proof is in the location being the same this is literally [ __ ] stupid because when you tweet you have an option to enable or disable your location and you can change the location to whatever you want the hacker didn't even need any skills to do this all he had to do was look at one of my previous tweets in fact he didn't even have to do that since there was a default option where every time you tweet your location it automatically is set to that location it's not based around your real location but rather the location that you have set not only that but great actually thinks that my girlfriend would refer to a friend of mine by his youtube channel named great purposely left out the full reading of the hackers tweet because it mentions only use me blade a fellow youtuber and friend and for that reason if grade-a under a had done even a tiny bit of research he would know that this so-called proof is [ __ ] or worse yet perhaps he purposely twisted the evidence to make this point appear valid she then told everyone about how kiemce attacked her with a set of car keys just look at some of these tweets my name is DJ keemstar and I like to physically and emotionally abuse my girlfriend I just started my girlfriend in the cheek with her own car keys this is actually from his girlfriend who has lived through hell so apparently this proof that he's a woman beer as well this is a lie he took something that made me look like a wife-beater didn't even do five minutes of research and still claimed it was proof and people believe this people believe this so even though grade had no proof to justify this particular attack allow me to provide the testimony from the actual person I'm being accused of beating hi my name is Melissa I'm Dan's girlfriend otherwise known as keemstar and I just wanted everyone know that he definitely 100% does not hit me and it's pretty ridiculous that I ruins making these accusations I was never on his Twitter and if he ever did hit me or anything like that me and my daughter would not be living with him grade-a under a has lied and twisted the truth to suit his own purposes not only that but his videos have only proved that he's a hypocrite he actively trot stuff up YouTube channels over boss sending his viewers to go in dis lock videos that he doesn't like obey is a pedo team I'm gonna tell you this right now obey is a pedo team here's their new video let's get a hundred dislikes in like three seconds not 74 we got a hundred and nine you [ __ ] piece of [ __ ] now as I've already explained I did that because people were literally making sexual references about my kid I'm not saying what I did was right but I lashed out an anger because of what they said not only has gray day under a conveniently left that part out but he then does the same exact thing to me if you hate keemstar this is your one chance to get rid of him so make a cow so grade-a under a calls me out for starting a bandwagon of hate against another channel but then does exactly the same thing but not only does he send a bigger bandwagon since I was on a stream and he made two videos that got millions of you he had far less justification for doing so these people have been making sexual references about my young child what's grades justification is a news channel on YouTube which reports drama and gossip it's basically the TMZ of YouTube so you know it's [ __ ] even this is a lie I was friends with grade a under a good friends and he has told me on multiple occasions that trauma ler was his favorite channel he even defended tromler as an entity in the past eg being neutral on drama and then been biased on Twitter that's not being two-faced he even says himself that I be honest yo Keem still has a lot of bad qualities right call me on this keeps all snow angels you don't I mean right but one thing I admire keemstar for is his honesty like he's not two-faced our own if he likes you it would be very apparent if he hates you it'd be very apparent so whether he was lying then or lying now either way it proves he's a liar and it's not like he's even made a mistake with something that happened 5/6 years ago he's deliberately sabotage the truth on very recent events he's deliberately sabotage the truth on very recent events let's talk about the Josh a thing for example so the backstory to this very briefly is basically this kid Josh was talking [ __ ] because this was a guy I helped out a lot in the past and now all of a sudden he was hating on me now I have just been stabbed in the back by two of my closed friends so to see this kid coming out of the woodwork that I helped in the past just do the same thing I forced a fair bit of my frustration in his direction now that's not the mistake I made I was trying to justify myself and in doing so I accidentally leaked this kid Skype what I did not realize is that his Skype username also contained his first and last name like how could I have possibly known that what I did [ __ ] up so when I watched his video I apologized to him we spoke in dm's as well and I cleared things up and I kindly asked him to take the video down he said it was no problem but he wanted to keep the video up because it was getting a lot of views he was getting a lot of subs and he needed money so I offered money to compensate him for the fact he took the video down I wasn't trying to manipulate him into taking the video down he already said it wasn't a problem but the only reason he had for not taking it down was that he needed money it all started whenever I tweeted a meme about keemstar being cringy so then he he tweets out my personal skype information which also has my last name in it which anybody can just find my facebook now and you know contact me or my family now I have to delete my facebook I have to delete my skype hey Josh I just seen your video and I guess I owe you an apology and I had no idea that your last name was in your skype so I'm sorry but then on his much less public stream like this Josh a kid is such a [ __ ] [ __ ] little coin like seriously [ __ ] this guy dude great play this clip to make it look like I apologized in public and then [ __ ] talked him on a live stream afterwards in order to make it seem like my apology was insincere now this was a fabrication of events he neglected to mention the fact that my Twitter apology occurred before Josh lied and that in fact my live stream rant was about the fact that he had manipulated by claiming I tried to bribe him I refuse to believe that grade a under a can [ __ ] something up this recent he has twisted the timeline of events to make it look worse than I really am he is purposely as many of you know I used to do halo trolling on Xbox Live the clip you just seen was from one of those trolls we would get in a game we would talk [ __ ] for entertainment of others I was playing a character the things I said in this character were not real I did not believe the things I said they were fake it was trash talk people were in on it everybody knew the game if you guys don't know who keep star is basically he does dramaalert he's the co-host on a podcast I do called the bad kids show or the bad kid cast whatever you want to call there's so many different names of it and for the most part he he's known in the community now for doing drama alert he used to be known for doing the trolling back like the real trolling back and I think gee not this new trolling where people just trap people corners and fake laughs just like [ __ ] the fans people take something I said seven years ago in a character and tried to use it as evidence to commend me as a person to try to prove I'm a racist or a sexist or whatever it was a comedy routine some of the things I said were offensive but it wasn't Daniel kiemce saying them it's not evidence of me legitimately insulting someone for real and the fact is that grade a under a knew this but he decided to use it anyway at no point did grade a under a give any reference to where this audio came from it was from a halo game it was from Xbox Live it was a troll he purposely extracted the audio from this video clip to convince an audience that it was hate speech as opposed to the reality of it being a trash-talking battle on Xbox Live digit or did was tell stories of what's happened in the past he literally laughs at kids what they cry their eyes out again they offer no backstory to this obviously this clip makes me look [ __ ] bad but it was a skit it's not real the mother of the kid was holding the camera it was staged we didn't randomly go up to a kid in the park and shove ice cream in his face and smash an xbox that is ridiculous that kid was a paid actor we paid him a hundred dollars to take part in this comedy skit and he was told beforehand after he gets hit with the ice cream he must cry if anything the kid should get an Oscar we recorded this and I didn't want to upload it simply because of how [ __ ] bad it would appear to seem to others but my friend only used me blade uploaded it anyway again it wasn't real it was an act a skit made in poor taste but absolutely a skit nonetheless being a hypocrite of course being a [ __ ] gnome there's so much more but I don't want to drag this on for too long so basically over all proves that it's a piece of [ __ ] I don't give a [ __ ] about any of you I am in this for your money I only do this show for money that's it all right I don't do it to entertain people that's just a [ __ ] scam I don't give a [ __ ] about any of you I really hope you die of cancer I hate every single one of you [ __ ] the fans no sarcasm no joking [ __ ] the fans thank you that's the thing with satire see leafy tried to shield his blatant attack videos with satire but this clip in which he claims to be proof of me being a piece of [ __ ] was again part of the whole [ __ ] the fans thing I've explained this game earlier I mean I literally say [ __ ] the fans in this clip the thing with leafies to videos is he doesn't really say anything he just calls me a rat and a gnome and a few times interlaced with clips of alex is a stupid n-word and some of my more cringy jokes apparently that was enough for people to say that he destroyed me his fans ate that [ __ ] up because of the recycled memes and because I was an easy target keemstar is notorious for [ __ ] backstabbing people and honestly I don't blame him this guy goes on and on about [ __ ] for [ __ ] days you were a [ __ ] you don't have money to [ __ ] pay for your [ __ ] apartment you have no money whatsoever you spent an extra 15 minutes on a stream that gets you no money and the only paycheck you got is coming from a [ __ ] bad kid show and you delayed this show oh well you don't have any money you don't have any money dude you're [ __ ] 35 years old what the [ __ ] is wrong with you this is a perfect example I don't even know what point he's trying to make here he's calling me a backstabber despite the fact that he's the one who's literally stabbing me in the back he tries to prove this by playing a clip of me joking with one of my best friends only use me blade like what the [ __ ] is even talking about this is just ridiculous it's just blind hatred and defamation of character by playing clips totally out of context to anything he's even saying to make me look bad there is no method to his madness no context no clarification no structure it is just a straight-up blatant attack masquerade it as jokes however leafy doesn't lie to the extent that grade a under a does because he doesn't do anything it's just a mess of audit context clips memes and stolen jokes is a news channel here on YouTube which reports drama and gossip it's basically the TMZ of YouTube so you know it's [ __ ] and only that right but it's run by a newscaster who carved [ __ ] read so for all of those that don't know I am dyslexic I do have trouble reading I don't really consider it my weakness I'm not offended when people say I can't read that doesn't make me any less intelligent or unable to run tromler using this to criticize my show was a pretty weak argument but I found it to be quite a low blow from a previous friend someone who knew I was dyslexic since we talked about it privately I think that's what hit me the hardest about this whole situation like I know people are calling me out for trying to play the victim card so I'm trying not to but these people were my friends I trusted them and they stabbed me in the back they use this thing of me allegedly shit-talking them as a reason to make these videos against me well not only is that untrue but the reasoning is also untrue if they really want to break the friendship and diss socialized themselves with me fine I accept that I can even understand it almost because everyone who's even remotely associated with me right now receives hey regardless even knowing me right now will make you a target for the mob mentality so yes it might be cowardly for them wanting to cut ties with me because of that but I really wanted to have held that against them I don't understand why the very next day just after our friendship ended that they just woke up and decided to make keemstar exposed videos and not only just any keemstar expose videos [ __ ] brutal ones with blatant lies and things taken out of context with zero backstory or reasoning and I don't think I'll ever understand why at this point but what I do understand was that this is the definition of a backstab they didn't just use a knife it was a [ __ ] machete and I realize it's me sounding like I'm playing the victim card but that is the part that makes me feel like a victim in that respect I'm not a victim in the sense that I haven't made mistakes myself but in the terms of the fact that these were my friends who turned on me the minute was easy for them to do so and came at me so [ __ ] hard you would have thought I killed one of their family members him being around definitely can make people go away and stop making videos and honestly right this is one of the biggest reasons why keemstar is a problem because your favorite youtuber could literally stop making videos tomorrow because of a stupid news story that came Star reports on tomorrow don't believe me look at Toby Turner firstly in what way is this news story stupid all we did is report on Toby Turner's alleged rape allegations the keyword was alleged it was in the [ __ ] title all we did is read out the tumblr post we didn't claim that the story was true all we did is have someone read out the tumblr post that his alleged victim wrote we didn't break the story we didn't twist the truth we literally read out something that someone else wrote in fact on this particular drum alert I gave no opinions whatsoever I didn't promote hate on Toby Turner I didn't tell anyone to attack him I brought a little more light to a post that already existed and that was it so this argument is [ __ ] if drum alert didn't cover the story someone else would have in fact a much bigger channel than drummer did cover it someone that grade has praised previously in his own videos Philip DeFranco ran this story and gave more of an actual opinion than I ever could fill Edie actually made more people aware of this story than I did and even then grades argument is that shedding light on a story like this is a bad thing when a isn't be wasn't a story broken by drama in the first place and C was covered by someone with a much larger audience those pitiful allegations against ba servers that Kim gave so much attention to weren't even true they were absolute folks right but that didn't stop him stuff from giving them as much attention as he [ __ ] could in fact try him so gave them so much attention that not only did they ruin Buster's reputation and this channel right but he ruined his [ __ ] sanity causing him to have a fully fledged mental breakdown we initially reported the story about a Minecraft youtuber known as bash reverse getting into trouble with the police like nine years ago for allegedly soliciting sex with a minor and I mean that is true bash reverse himself uploaded a video telling this exact story before the drama ler in question even came out now this story was handled unprofessionally there was no lid on it a lot of people jumped to conclusions and I regret not making more of an effort to reduce the amount of hate he received on its behalf but drama ler besides being both unprofessional and unequipped to handle the scope of this story didn't actually report false information the truth is the bash of her story itself is just too huge to explain it really needs its own video and if need be I will do that in a separate upload in short I do accept some responsibility for how the story played out but drama ler never reported on anything that wasn't true keemstar invaded my privacy some of these pictures never left my personal facebook page I will admit I overreacted to this pyrocynical thing I did blow it out of proportion and I do apologize to pyrocynical for reacting and that way I reacted yes I was wrong to post his picture online to try to get back at him it was Petty and childish but this is not a pyrocynical face reveal his image was public I did not release his image to the world not only was his image available on Google but his own friends and fans have been posting his face around twitter for months he even posted pictures of himself himself even a video where he was brushing his [ __ ] teeth when he said that I got photos from his private Facebook that was a lie these images were public long before and I know this because I obtained them in the first place from a simple google image search and for final proof that pyrocynical showed his face long before anyone else did On January 9th 2016 he literally gave a youtuber known as uber danger permission to use his own face reveal in a video a video that got over 1 million views a [ __ ] combination of the best and worst creatures to ever come out of Planet Earth dinosaurs and furries [ __ ] a will admit I've posted pictures of keemstar myself but the pictures I've taken are all from his Twitter page or his dramaalert channel pictures he willingly uploaded to his audience to see meanwhile he's using private pictures of me that I didn't upload for the public to see that is simply not true his followers would actively reply to his tweets with pictures and some of them he posted himself I did not expose private pictures I did not expose anything all the images I post it were already public pyrocynical posted my image and yes these images were public but so were his for pyro to claim that they weren't is a lie he lied to everyone now what I did was Petty and I admit that but I did not expose pyrocynical 's face reveal and he has manipulated people into thinking I had look at the toils there were massive tags and YouTube names to promote yourself in the algorithms here's a perfect example of why pyrocynical video is flawed and hypocritical he criticizes my titles but look at his [ __ ] titles he's doing this same exact thing if not worse not that there's really even anything wrong with it my point is how the [ __ ] is this relevant to the title of his video my personal experiences with keemstar he's just criticizing me for something that he does too but actually to an even greater extent and the same way that I was patty on Twitter he's being patty in this video there is wrong on both sides here but people simply don't want to see that Oh straight up lying about situations in a pathetic attempt to slander another individual girl from France all right now this is something deliberately taken out of context by blatantly misleading his audience he purposely chosen this clip to make it look like I'm calling pyrocynical a pedophile when that is not what I said at all he has directly cut the beginning of this sentence out which actually made what I said completely different as you can see the exact same segment but this time actually in context with what I said so instead of a clip of me sang pyrocynical was trying to hook up with a 13 year old girl from France it now mentions the fact that it's his friends that are saying this and not me this is what his friends said not keemstar but it was deliberately cut out by pyrocynical to make it look like I was the one saying it now I agree I have [ __ ] up the ages well that's because these so-called friends were telling me multiple different ages and I got [ __ ] confused but in any case I was not calling pyrocynical a pedophile I was saying what his friends had said this was not news this was not evidence all I was doing is relaying what people had said do I believe his friends no I don't but multiple people were saying the same thing to me and I was looking into it at the time if pyrocynical wants to point the finger at someone for this he should point it at for directly trying to feed me false information and this is also something that people need to understand I was not reporting the news on my stream this was never featured on drama lured drama is a news program my stream and Twitter are not and some people refuse to understand this well it's pretty [ __ ] simple drama lured is drama so it's called drama ler the channel is not called keemstar is my twitter handle drama Lert no it's not is my streams called drama ler no it's not these are not affiliated with drama lured I try to keep my opinions off of drama lured omitting ly sometimes unsuccessful but that's a place for news yes keemstar reports the news and on drama ler I have tried to stay as neutral as possible not always easy but can you blame me given the fact that people criticize me when I want to actually give my opinion on something that isn't drama ler I'm sorry but this shouldn't be that difficult to comprehend 15 completely bollock naked on DJ keemstar block TV stream and that pieces of paper saying I love King Stach covering her tits and her [ __ ] out of all of the keemstar expose videos this is honestly the biggest [ __ ] lie that has ever been told it's not even taking something out of context at this point it's direct slander grade-a under a my once close friend has literally called me a pedophile needless to say this story is total [ __ ] and I dispute every [ __ ] word of it keemstar himself had to go of the exact same age 15 years old get naked for him on a knife stream to the best of my knowledge there was a moderator in my stream called Kate's Kate was a 19 year old who was dating another moderator in my stream that was in his early 20s is it possible that Kant lied about her age of course it is I don't request I D from the moderators of my stream or the viewers of my stream this girl of her own free will streamed herself naked with DJ keemstar fansigns on her own stream this was not my stream the fact that grade a under a accepts this video as evidence automatically is absolutely laughable he did no research and neither did Joey [ __ ] salads but at least Joey has an excuse of being an actual idiot and even says in the video that there's probably a logical explanation to it grade a under a didn't even do that he just accepted that this was the fact and was insane enough to try to make people think that I was genuinely a pedophile I'll put it to Joey salads for this investigative gem right your only source is Joey salads an idiot who literally pissed in his own mouth and stuck his dick in a hot dog bun and by the way Joey didn't research this either he wasn't even the one to break this little story but you did so little to verify it that neither of you even asked me one question about it you called me the worst thing in the world based on nothing and that on its own is worse than anything I have ever done myself colossal is crazy spent two months of research on this and still believed there was not enough evidence to even consider running the story which by the way it was the reason for my tweet to him in the first place a certain youtuber by the name of colossal is crazy made a tweet saying he's gonna make a video about keemstar and how does keemstar respond to this get this by threatening to release his personal info on where he [ __ ] lives you're obsessed with me I have a portfolio of all your tweets mentioning me when your pet Oh video hits expect a response docs to this is an untruth in itself I never threatened to Doc's colossal as crazy because he was making a video on me it's something I said because I found out he was researching this PTO's story and I thought he was generally going to try to expose me for being a [ __ ] pedophile this was actually a misunderstanding anyway because the clown had concluded that there was no evidence to prove it yes I was wrong for threatening to DOX him but I apologized he forgave me and it was resolved he actually got hate for accepting my apology which is ridiculous and its own right and just goes to show how [ __ ] deep the mob mentality really goes who came to even mention Paolo cynical talking to a 15 year old girl in a bad way is [ __ ] crazy given the fact that keemstar again literally had a gun of the exact same age get naked and show her bare naked [ __ ] in all its underaged glory and this is just ridiculous now grey tries to call me a hypocrite for calling pyrocynical a pedophile which again I never said I was just relaying what his friends had told me grey says I'm a pedo and that's because I called pyro a pedo it's hypocritical but isn't that at the same time just making grade a [ __ ] hypocrite himself has he gone mad he's trying to expose me for falsely accusing pyro of being a pedo by falsely accusing me of being a pedo if this was legitimately grades motive its actually [ __ ] stupid and the fact that he doesn't see that is insane but honestly I think he's just using it as an excuse to try to get people to believe that I am actually a pedo I mean at no point in either of his videos does he explain his intentions he doesn't use words like allegedly or possibly or potentially he literally just calls me a [ __ ] pedophile it's a direct quote a fifteen-year-old go completely bollock naked on DJ keemstar blog TV stream and that pieces of paper saying I love King Stach covering her tits and her [ __ ] if that isn't slander I honestly don't know what is and the fact that he used the next clip only reveals how stupid his entire video really is it's obvious to me that he doesn't really care about being right or wrong he doesn't give a [ __ ] about what's the truth and what's not the truth he was counting on the fact that people would take him at his word and he was right people did people now generally believe that I'm actually a pedophile that once convinced a 15 year old girl to get naked the hate for me is so strong the bandwagon is so full that grade a didn't even need to provide even one scrap of [ __ ] evidence to justify calling someone the worst thing in the world but the mindless [ __ ] sheep believed in anyways in May 2013 there was a guy in Britain called Steven rudram who got falsely accused of being a pedophile on the Internet right on top of that his privacy got [ __ ] on lock his real name and other information came out as well the combination of the false pitiful allegations and his privacy being [ __ ] on made him take his [ __ ] life remember this okay remember these details okay grade I remember the details see the way I see it by your logic you have now made a false pitot accusation against me in addition to this my privacy has actually been intruded upon multiple times which you [ __ ] knew about because guess what you were my friend and I told you this so by your logic there is a chance I could potentially kill myself so all you have done here is shoot yourself in the foot and totally reversed your argument upon yourself now I have absolutely no plans to kill myself but as you well know all it takes is one crazy [ __ ] to believe this allegation and get a hold of my address which is practically public anyways and do something [ __ ] stupid by your own logic you have not only put my own life at risk by tricking people into believing this pedo allegation but my family's too so now do you begin to see where you [ __ ] up you don't think that keemstar get poorer cynical is such a hard time for talking to a 15 year old girl cuz he was jealous do you I'm gonna rape your kids fix knacks what do you say so I guess this is a joke I don't know but since people actually still believe I hope my fans get cancer thing not to mention all the other ridiculous [ __ ] I've disproved once and for all I reckon I should probably clarify this story to be in the safe side this big Snax thing was again taken completely out of context in the early days of drama were on a different Channel drama were exposed the story that big snacks a fellow youtuber was bahding YouTube views a hacker known as the doctor took pictures of big snacks family and made threats that he wanted to rape big snacks kids the youtuber big snacks responded by telling people that keemstar wanted to rape his kids that I was the one that put the hacker known as doctor up to this I responded on my stream by saying and I quote I cannot believe he's saying this he's saying I want to rape your kids big snacks but the I can't believe he's saying this part was cut out of the clip to make it look like I was saying I genuinely wanted to rape his kids this was a manipulation of the facts here's a clip from cast silencer who was big snacks business partner of many years confirming this right a undereyes video dropped yesterday which I have I have a few issues with grade-a underaged video I watched the entire thing and he he was smart from his point he made it part 1 in part 2 that just gives double exposure for the message he's trying to get across but I had a few issues because there was some things in there in some clips specifically the big snacks clip now I'm not defending keemstar I was in that battle with keemstar back in the day when it was with big snacks and yash and everything and keep started some stupid [ __ ] he's done some real stupid [ __ ] but if you're going to expose somebody you give them the entire clip and grade a under a multiple times as did leafy they cut clips to where it sounded like something it wasn't like where he was talking about raping a big snacks kids that wasn't the entire clip and if you watch the entire clip you were taken in context and they cut it down just to make it sound like that now I know they're going for this full expose and I get it and if you have valid proof on things by all means throw it out there but make sure you you keep it in context because it's gonna come back and look kind of shady if people look and say well that's not what he was saying why did you why did you cut comment to make it look like something it was it and they did that numerous times now it's important for me to focus on the things I have done wrong and yes I have [ __ ] up multiple times I have because I'm a human possibly one of the greatest mistakes I've made is a mistake I have absolutely no defense for whatsoever and that is what I said to totalbiscuit it was totally insensitive and I deeply deeply apologize for it look ya [ __ ] piece of [ __ ] I've been [ __ ] watching you for years I'm gonna fan of you for years are the blue you tweet at me you're not news and that you [ __ ] block me why oh I've never even [ __ ] said anything about you at all like now I want to now I want to be like hmm can't wait to report your death like seriously what's wrong with you [ __ ] I uploaded a 10-minute apology video on Twitter after speaking with h3h3 and I realized not only with what I said the totalbiscuit was offensive but it also hurt anyone that has suffered from cancer in any shape or form whether it was themself or through loved ones I'm ashamed of what I said and I understand I have made an enormous mistake that I will forever regret now I could attempt to defend myself by referencing many of the good things that I've done many I felt a lot of people out I've helped people out that even talked about in this video but that's not what this video is about this video is not about me manipulating you into thinking I'm a good guy it's for me to tell you the truth I've made mistakes and I have admitted to these mistakes but most of what you heard about me was manipulated taken out of context or straight-up lies and many of you have been hating on me for that I don't hold it against you and in fact I'm here asking for forgiveness and I'm prepared to forgive you in the next couple days I will be unblocking everyone I have blocked on Twitter that has sent me hate up until this point for the things that are simply not true I will also be forgiving the people that have uploaded these keemstar exposed videos as long as they apologize either publicly or privately as I said before I cannot go and undo the things that I've done wrong I hope that this is a fresh start I hope that this is a new chapter thank you for making it to the end thank you for listening to me you,On,Original

12,FunForLouis,YouTube,"Aug 18, 2016",MY RESPONSE... (youtube.com),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8U1ZGMDlASA,hey guys I making a video today to respond to the massive amount of criticism I've had over my North Korea Vlogs I don't know if you've seen but I'm all over the Press with accusations that I'm being paid by the North Korean government as a tool for propaganda and uh although that makes great headlines there there's no truth in that whatsoever I'm not being paid by the North Korean government and uh actually I I want to make a statement now I do not agree with the North Korean ideologies but I do care for and love the people there for those of you that are new to my channel my name is Louie I travel the world having fun adventures and I share those with my audience I've been to developed countries developing countries with a range of political problems and social justice issues uh two of my favorite cities Cape Town and Rio have the biggest wealth disparity in the world but I am looking for the beautiful positive things uh I want to connect with local people learn about the culture and the country I am not a investigative journalist I don't really do political commentary and there are other places on the internet you can go to find those kind of things so this trip to North Korea as many of my trips I went on as a tourist and we went on an organized tour so the same kind of tour anyone going there as a tourist would experience and as much as we can be skeptical about how much was real and how much was staged that is what I experienced and I can only share with you guys what I experienced so that's what I did on my videos the Assumption I made which may have been wrong of me was that people watching my North Korea Vlogs would have already had a broader perspective on North Korea they would have seen documentaries they would have seen news articles uh as I have and I want to reassure you that I do know what's going on out there uh and not being naive to it all um and maybe I should have at the beginning of each Vlog encourage people to go and do their own research and find out all that they can about North Korea so I want to explain how I ended up going on the trip now my friend Lane posted on Facebook that he was going or wanted to go so I contacted him and found out that he was going with an organization that were running their third annual surf school so I asked if I could join the team and come along so the guy organizing these trips has been visiting North Korea for 17 years doing humanitarian relief work he doesn't work for the government but he has been building a relationship with the government and with the people there and I don't want to jeopardize any of the work that he's done with the content I've been creating so Philip DeFranco he's a popular YouTuber and he made a video about this unfolding drama he criticized me with an analogy about being taken on a tour around a big mansion knowing that there's rooms with murder and torture going on in them but only being shown to the rooms like the nice swimming pool and the kitchen and the games room and then leaving that Mansion just talking about those things my only question to that is what about the people in the house that are in those rooms in the nicer rooms I think the only way to make a difference is to connect with those people people and show them love and maybe uh that will impact the entire household so if that means surfing or going on these tours uh then I'm really Keen to do that and I'm the only thing that's sad is I can't show you all of the relationships that I've built and the conversations I've had off camera which I think is something I always struggle with with my Vlogs in Pyongyang the capital we went to a water park and we were surfing in the wave pool there and there was this one moment where I looked around and there were eight different nations represented there was people from Sweden Switzerland Canada the US the UK North Korea um Russia I think there's another one Finland okay and the Russian guy was actually just at the water park and he was from the embassy the Russian Embassy and one of the North Korean tour guys turned to us and said um surfing brings peace and I think that was a very strong message and I I think it really does I really really think it you know as a as you've seen with the Olympics a lot of sporting activities I don't know you saw the selfie of the North and South Korean gymnasts uh with a peace sign that I'll show you here like for me uh those things break down barriers and I think that was the whole purpose of us being able to connect with people out there so I'll leave you with this final thought a North Korean business specialist Felix at said if you have no presence in the country you cannot influence anything for the better and I think the future of our relationship like our the international community's relationship with North Korea is fully dependent on how well we know them and the intention of this trip was to go out and get to know them better and I'm happy to say I made some friends out there and I'm really looking forward to going out to visit them again,On,Original

14,Tana Mongeau,YouTube,"Feb 18, 2017",An apology,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fazh9Lm1kDE,hi today's video is going to be the hardest video I've ever had to film and I'm not going to lie to you I am so nervous and I've spent the past week doing nothing but running away from my problems and hiding from all my problems and trying to avoid this because that's what I do best when I have a problem I push it under the rug and I run away from it and I hide from it until I can't anymore and I woke up today and was like I need to face this headon I owe the people that subscribe to me and the people that love me and the people who supported me through everything and the people who are supporting me through this I owe them an explanation and an apology with no excuses and so that's what I'm going to do today I'm going to own up to everything I've done wrong going to own up to all of my mistakes I'm going to apologize for them and I want you guys to know that I'm really thankful for anybody who is still here to listen I honestly don't deserve the amount of love and support you guys have been giving me this past week and the amount of you that are still here to like hear me out is like insane I feel very blessed and I know no matter what there are going to be people that hate me there going to be people that dislike this video they're going to be people that leave hate comments they're going to be people that won't hear me out that don't care what I have to say and I understand that and honestly I deserve it but to those of you left that are here to hear me out and hear what I have to say and listen to my apology I'm really thankful for that and thank you for continuing to support me even when I'm wrong as [ __ ] let's get into the video the first thing I want to talk about is the main thing the thing that is everywhere and that is videos of me saying the nword and more importantly the half-ass disgusting shitty way that I apologized for them in the past so basically long story short there are a few videos of me as a freshman in high school calling my best friend Amari who is black the nword and he's filming me and while I've apologized for those before I look back to my apologies in the past and and I am so [ __ ] ashamed of them they are so half ass and bad and they're literally just straight lies I know that there's this one video of me where I literally come on Snapchat and say hey I know that there's videos of me saying the nword well MC Miller says it and I thought it meant homie or friend I'm sorry we all grow we all learn I made a mistake bye and I watch that video now and I cringe so [ __ ] hard at how much of a [ __ ] lying stupid idiot I was I just want to say first and foremost to everybody asking me this question they're like why would you say you thought it meant homie or friend if in the video you were saying it in a derogatory way I said I thought it me homie your friend cuz I was a [ __ ] idiot those videos started to go viral and surface everywhere and honestly I was terrified the first time they ever surfaced I was so scared and so [ __ ] terrified of anybody thinking that I was a racist that I pushed it under the rug I said that I thought it me homier friend because I wanted to make it seem like less of a big deal because I was so scared and I realized now how much easier it would have just been at that time to come on and say hey when I was filming those videos I was an ignorant teenager who thought it would be shocking and funny to call my black friend the nword while he filmed it and all of our friends thought it was so shocking and so funny and we thought it was a joke and now I've grown up and I've changed I've learned so much and I've matured and now I never want to say that word I'm not racist I know it's wrong to say that word and I don't think you guys should say it either and if I would have came on and apologize like that months ago I wouldn't even be dealing with this now I wouldn't even be going through this but instead I was a coward and I was afraid and I thought it would be easier to pacify everything and just come on Snapchat and pretend like I had no idea what it meant of course I knew what it meant my friend was black and all of my friends thought it was so funny to say like slurs to him and stupid [ __ ] because it was shocking and funny and then I grew up and I learned the pain behind that word and the depth behind that word and the history behind that word and I knew it was wrong and I was ashamed of my past and I thought that it was easier to just pretend like I had no idea and I'm sorry for that I should have owned up to my wrongs not half ass but entirely I should have told you guys the truth and that I knew what it meant I should have told you guys the entire truth to begin with I should have apologized sincerely and fully instead of waiting until now to do it and I honestly learned a giant lesson from that and that is when something surfaces of me doing something wrong I get called out for [ __ ] in the future I will stop right there and no matter how terrified I am of people thinking a certain way of me or something because of mistakes I've made that it's a lot less hard for me in the long run just to own up to it right then and there fully honestly and apologize for it because we're all only human and we all make mistakes but why I'm so wrong in this situation is because I didn't say I made a mistake I knew what it meant I just thought I was being shocking and funny I said I was 14 MC Miller says it please forgive me like what a [ __ ] idiot and I'm sorry for being so [ __ ] stupid I was just scared and I thought that that was the right thing to do and it sucks that I I'm in this industry where people all and this isn't an excuse by the way I I it's still wrong but where people all around you are constantly telling you like don't address it or just sweep it under the rug make it seem like it's not a big deal and I took that advice and it bit me in the ass but I'm not using that as an excuse I I know right from wrong I I should have said no I need to say I said it I knew what it meant and I was an idiot I'm sorry for being a [ __ ] coward and I'm sorry for giving you guys such a stupid apology and explanation because you mean so much more to me than that you guys are worth so much more than that and you guys are my family and I've always prided myself on being really real with you guys and in that moment apologizing like that was the least real thing I could have done and I think that that's why I regret it the most because promised you guys I would always be real with you and I think that in that moment I could have been a lot more real with you all in all I said the nword in those videos I knew what it meant regardless of me knowing the depth of it or the pain behind it or anything like that I knew that it was a slur and my friends and I thought it was shocking and offensive and funny to say to Omari cuz he was black and he was okay with it and he thought it was funny and blah blah blah and so I made stupid Vines like that and when they surface like I said I was scared as [ __ ] and I didn't want people to think I was a racist because I was such an activist Against Racism so I swept it under the rug and I gave you guys the most half ass excuse filled apology hoping that that would pacify it and I could go back to being an activist and being Against Racism and I'm sorry for that and I learned that next time I get called out for some stupid ass [ __ ] I did in the past I need to own up to it right then and there and face that headon own up to Everything I did and apologize in order to move on properly now this second thing I want to address is a lot of people are saying that I'm only apologizing because of this giant Scandal because idbs called me out because everybody's talking about it because everybody's making videos about it and honestly those people are right had this not happened to me had idbs not made that video had the entire world been looking at my channel under this microscope and criticizing me and calling me out for my wrongs I would have never made this video I would have never owned up to it I would have never had to face it the way that I am right now now I would have continued to give half ass shitty apologies like I was previously I would have continued to push it under the rug and run away from my problems like I always do I would have never made a video like this because I would have been too afraid and in a really [ __ ] up weird way I am glad all of this is happening because I have to face my problems I have to face the past I have to own up to Everything I did wrong I think that this has all taught me a really valuable lesson to think about what I say before I say and to not just run to the computer and run to Snapchat and be an idiot and that kind of brings me to my next point which is my tweet to idbs telling him to kill himself that I deleted that's actually why like all of this started is because a while ago someone showed me idbs video and I heard him saying the nword and I ran to Twitter and tweeted him and said why do you say the n-word kill yourself and then after like a few minutes I deleted it my best way of explaining that is that I am such an impulsive idiot I'm such an impulsive person whenever I think something I run to Twitter to tweet it whenever something makes me mad the first thing I do is like grab my phone and Snapchat about it or tweet about it or live stream about it like that live stream of me saying I hope he breaks both of his legs do I actually hope he breaks both of his legs do I actually hope he kills himself no but I'm impulsive and stupid and I run to my phone and I run to my live stream when someone makes me mad and I tweet stupid [ __ ] like that and that was so stupid like I I heard him saying the n word I got annoyed and I ran to Twitter and I said that first of all I had no place to be telling anybody not to say the nword when I never owned up and apologized fully to me saying the n-w like it had been one thing like I said if I had genuinely apologized and actually owned up to the [ __ ] I'd done in the past and then I wanted to call someone out like T how [ __ ] dare you call someone else out for saying something when you haven't even owned up properly to you saying it and I never would have if it wasn't for this whole situation so it just I was so stupid and telling him to kill himself was so wrong regardless of if someone makes you mad you should never say that to anybody and I know that idubz is like strong and he would never actually like kill himself and like he can take things like that but but there are lots of people that can't and me being this person who advocates for positivity and talks people out of suicide and talks about how suicide is never the answer and how it gets better and all this [ __ ] and I'm going to promote saying something like that like that's so [ __ ] stupid and obviously after tweeting it I knew that that was wrong and I deleted it but I think that it taught me a lesson in the bigger picture that when something does annoy me to not go be impulsive and crazy and [ __ ] run to Twitter and run to YouNow and like say [ __ ] that I probably shouldn't say I think that a lot of the [ __ ] that's happening is a big lesson to me to really think about what I say before I say it because I have this huge platform I have this voice I need to be smarter about the things that I say and the things that I do before I do them so I am sorry for that I'm sorry for telling anyone to kill themselves whether it's serious or not I obviously didn't want him to kill himself but I should not be promoting the use of saying that I should not be promoting the use of saying anything hateful to anyone whether it's impulsive or not like that's not an excuse like oh I'm impulsive so I can say that no think about what the [ __ ] you say before you say it Hannah so from this point on I'm going to make sure to think about everything I say before I run to my camera before I run to Twitter before I am a hypocrite and I call someone else out for saying the n-word when I had no right to call anybody else out because I hadn't addressed my past I think that that was so wrong and hypocritical of me to call someone else out when I hadn't like called myself out you know when I hadn't actually apologized and owned up to the things that I'd done so I'm sorry for that it was impulsive and it was stupid and I was wrong as [ __ ] and now the last thing I want to apologize for is explaining the idub situation differently than it happened in my nword video honestly that day when that happened like UBS coming to my meet and greet when you're doing a meet and greet you you get into meet and great mode I guess you could say you're used to everybody coming up to you with all love and all positivity and all happiness and when someone approaches you wearing your merch you think that they're there to love you and support you and then they do something that scares the [ __ ] out of you it really sends your brain into like insanity and I know that the people who watch idbs aren't going to understand where I'm coming from in this sense because when you watch idbs you know he's not scary you know he's not a scary person but I didn't know it was UBS at the time when he came up to me and when somebody comes up to you dressed as a fan and they put their arm around you and they try to get you to say something that you hate it is very scary if you watch UBS and you're an idubz fan you don't see that perspective at all because you watch idbs he's funny you know he's like harmless you know he wasn't going to hurt me but I didn't know it was idbs at the time and I thought it was just someone trying to [ __ ] with me and someone trying to scare me and I never really gave myself time to really think about the situation I feel like if I could have actually given myself some time to think about it instead of like I said in the last thing like running to Twitter and being impulsive and like I had to go on stage right after that and be funny and be YouTube tana and I was impulsive and I talked about it then because I'm an impulsive person and when something happens to me that's that's what I do I I get emotional and I run to Twitter and I run to YouTube and I film a video and all that kind of stuff and I never gave myself a chance to really sit back and think about the situation and obviously in my head this situation was a lot longer it's it was more dramatic it was more it was so much more than just that 1 second video of him with his arm around my shoulder saying like say blank like it was so much more than that to me it was consuming my entire thoughts and as I thought about it and thought about it I became more emotional and I spoke from entirely like emotion if that makes sense and I was obviously looking into the camera and not looking at him and I literally swear to God I swear to you when I look back to the situation I remember nothing more than him like doing a thumbs up but I guess he didn't that's why I was wrong I should have waited for the video to surface I should have made sure all of my facts were entirely straight but when I made the nword video I didn't think it was idbs I wasn't trying to like ruin his career or anything like that I wasn't trying to like hurt anybody or ruin anybody I thought it was a random person and obviously I wasn't intending to lie or exaggerate that situation at all because I knew that the video of the person saying say N word to me was eventually going to come out whether it was UBS or not they were going to post it they were filming it for a reason you know so what would I get out of lying about it just for the video to surface and then me to look like an idiot when it's different than it happened that's genuinely how I thought it happened but I'm [ __ ] stupid for not making sure that that's exactly how it happened before talking about it I'm stupid for being impulsive and just speaking about the situation and not worrying about details because in the end it just made me look like more of an exaggerative like liar and so I learned a giant [ __ ] lesson from this and that's when you're telling stories make sure the details are right especially when you're live like I'm so stupid like my livelihood my career comes from me telling stories comes from me talking about my life and so if I get a fact of a very important story wrong that's going to make every story I ever tell for the rest of ever look less credible like that wasn't my intention obviously that's the last thing I would want to do is ruin the one thing that I like love to do I don't want people to watch me and think that I'm some exaggerative liar now so I'm sorry for that I'm sorry for exaggerating the details of something because I hadn't sat back to reflect on them perfectly I'm sorry for not telling it perfect fact for fact how it happened I was speaking straight from emotion that's how I thought I remembered it so I did no [ __ ] research and I just spoke off of my head and off of my heart and that's what I said I had no intention of hurting ubbs or ruining his career or anything like that because I didn't even know it was him filming that but regardless that doesn't make it okay next time you tell people about something serious that happened to you make sure that you were telling it moment for moment exactly how it happened so I you don't lose credibility like it it's not that hard and I'm an idiot for taking something like that so lightly and I shouldn't have sat down and ran to the camera and filmed that video when I was in an emotional state I should have waited for that video to come out watched it and made sure that when I talked about it I was talking about it exactly as it happened word for word so I'm sorry for that as well I'm sorry forever using the term like choke hold I tried to explain in that video that it wasn't a choke hold but I still just like I didn't explain it well enough I should have literally said his arm was around my shoulder but I remembered it so much dramatically and differently than it actually happened and I explained it that way I explained it from dramatic emotion like a [ __ ] idiot and I realized that filming something when you're still emotional about it causes for you to be over over dramatic and it causes for you to speak from your emotion and so I guess I realized from that situation that I shouldn't sit down and run to the camera and film something when I'm still like emotional about it or right after it happened if that means that I can't not speak from emotion and not like I should have taken a break and reflected and calmed down and not filmed it when I was still frustrated and scared and feeling all of those emotions and I'm sorry for that all in all this is a giant wakeup call for me before I run to the camera or before I run to Twitter I need to reflect more I need to think about what I'm going to say more and I need to make sure it's not going to affect another person's life I don't want to rely on being over dramatic to make good content I don't need that I I genuinely can be funny without being over dramatic without being exaggerative or any of those things I don't want to lose my credibility I don't want people to look at me like I'm a liar so I need to work on thinking and reflecting to make sure that everything I say is completely factual and genuine the next time I have a scandal or I get called out for something or a video of me doing something dumb comes up I need to face it headon no matter how scared of it I am and I need to address it fully and entirely and apologize then and there for that situation so that it doesn't grow to be something much bigger because of me being an idiot I need to learn that I can't deal with things by pushing them away because it creates situations like this if I want to be an activist for something and I have a past of doing something that negates that I need to own up to my past entirely before calling out other people like a hypocrite because that doesn't make you more of an activist it just makes you a hypocritical idiot and I learned that lesson I'm still going to continue to be an activist Against Racism and for equality and I won't ever say that word I want you guys to know that this situation doesn't change what I believe in I still am so Against Racism and so against inequality but I needed to own up to my past before I could continue to be about those things and I want you guys to know this video isn't just me saving my career or something like that like I'm genuinely trying to better myself this situation has taught me more about life than anything in the past five years I genuinely feel like I'm coming out of this situation stronger this past week this past week I've received more hate than I thought possible in my entire YouTube career I've never let the hate get to me never once have I read hate comments and believed them until now this past week would read comments of people telling me they wanted me to kill myself and I've never Never Felt This Feeling before but I genuinely was like should I like would the world be a better place without me I've never felt the feeling of comments actually affecting you like that I think that I always would look at people who got affected by hate comments as like weak and I never understood it and now I'm so much more empathetic to people that do get hurt by things over the Internet or do read hate comments and get upset because I I know what it feels like now I know what it feels like to get online and see nothing but people hating you and genuinely believe the internet would be a better place without me or that the world would be a better place without me for that matter I finally felt what it feels like to feel like the whole world hates you and to not want to live because of it and I I don't want like a a pity party I'm not asking for that but I'm saying that this situation made me so much more empathetic to so many other people and it taught me so much and I'm excited to continue to grow and mature from this I'm excited to work on a lot of things about myself I'm excited to continue to grow because I look back at how little I knew and how ignorant I was and how stupid I was when I was 14 and 15 and doing all that dumb [ __ ] and I look at myself now and I look at how much I've grown and how much of a better person I am now and how much more I know now and I'm excited to continue to do that and in 3 years look back to me now and be like damn I was really dumb then I'm glad I learned even more and I think that's what life is all about is making mistakes and owning up to them and growing and continuing to make more mistakes and owning up to them and growing more because that's what we do as human beings and I think that where I was the most wrong in this whole situation was not owning up to my mistakes properly and I'm excited in a way that I'm getting to do this that in this video because now I can properly grow and properly grow up and move on and mature and this has been the hardest week of my life but with that comes a lot of learning and I'm really really thankful in a really weird way that this happened now so I could stop myself and backtrack and learn a lot of [ __ ] and own up to all of the dumb [ __ ] I've done and move on so I'm going to shut up now I told you guys I wasn't going to ramble and this was going to be a short video but here we are like every video ever thank you to anybody still by my side I learned this week how valuable and fragile and precious my place here on the Internet is and how really really lucky I am to have this platform and the fact that a lot of you guys chose to stay and hear me out makes me feel so grateful and so lucky that I have a family that forgives me and that knows I'm only human and makes mistakes but holds me accountable for them and holds me accountable for when I apologize wrong and holds me accountable for when I lie and holds me accountable for when I'm a [ __ ] idiot I'm so thankful that I built a fan base of genuine real people that will call me the [ __ ] out when I deserve it thank you for everything for being the reason why I'm still alive this week I literally wanted to die so badly and the only reason why I didn't do anything or like act upon I guess you could say is because I knew that a lot of you guys would be hurt and that I don't want to be that kind of example I want to be the example of strength when hate is coming your way or when life is down on you and I'm so thankful that you guys give me a platform to be able to be that example all in all I love you guys so much and I'm sorry for everything that I've done wrong in this video thank you for hearing me out and listening I hope you can accept my apology if you can't I understand I've made a million mistakes but from this point on I really do intend on changing a lot and holding myself a lot more accountable and being a lot more brutally honest and upfront with you guys and I want to spend the next few months getting back to exactly where I came from which is making silly crazy content that I love to make and making you guys smile and laugh by doing it I want to get back to being real as [ __ ] I want to be as real as I possibly can in all of my content from this point forward I don't want to ever give anybody a reason to ever question my my credibility again and I want to continue being an activist for what I believe in all right guys thank you so much for listening to everything that I have to say thank you guys for supporting me through all of my wrongs and I'm going to shut the [ __ ] up now and stop rambling and I will talk to you guys and it feels so good to say this I will talk to you guys in the next video where I am back to crazy ass not impulsive ass Dana bye,On,Original
15,JonTron Lost Videos,YouTube,"Mar 19, 2017",My Statement: - JonTron (HD) (youtube.com),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krOOThz3fJg,well this certainly has been an interesting week so recently as you may have heard I had a public debate about some contentious topics relevant to the day I blew up in the media and they wrote some how you say charitable articles on me so I feel like I need to come out and say something saying silence doesn't really feel right so I'm just going to address this here and now I understand that I wasn't prepared for a debate of this sort with these kinds of sensitive topics at hand adequately you know I was a bit all over the place and I said a lot of stuff that could be misconstrued in all sorts of ways think things are being extracted from this that I know I don't think yeah I was in there under a lot of pressure that I'm not used to being under and as it became clear I suck at debate so now every haphazard offhand remark I made in the heat of the moment is being dissected and speculated on so I like to clarify I was trying to speak to the increasing tribal ovations of our culture these days were taught to think in explicitly racial or ethnic categories or in terms of gender or sexual orientation and I think there's an excel plays a big hand in what's got in our country to the volatile state that is in the simple point I was trying to make is that it's hypocritical for those who see everything in terms of race to suddenly turn around and object when white people speak up in what they believe are the best interests of their race and it's also hypocritical to keep saying you want to have an honest conversation about race if you don't actually want to have an honest conversation about race and anytime someone brings up an uncomfortable statistic you freak out and burn things down or something and I mean you can see this and all the countless media articles that get pumped out every day from the highest level saying for instance you can't be racist against white people or it's a good thing whites are going to become a minority or you see it on TV when someone is mainstream is samantha bee says white people ruined America for voting Trump it's pretty clear who ruined America white people I suppose you could get the reaction if Samantha bee said black people ruined America for voting overwhelmingly for Barack Obama which they did both times I'm not saying that's true but the same standard applies the point I was trying to make Albion and delicately is that you can't banging the racial category drum and then be surprised and shocked when people think in racial categories and just for the sake of total clarity I do completely understand that historically the african-american community has had a raw deal in this country discrimination certainly exists but I do believe it goes always I'm not naive to the fact that we as a country have had a terrible history of dealing with race I mean of course from slavery to Jim Crow to even the Irish but the point is that this kind of discrimination is universally wrong and I feel like for some reason we're regressing on this front pointing at a race and saying all of this race is blank is racist and I have to be honest I don't see many people losing their jobs over this kind of garbage and I'd like to make it clear I have no problem with immigration when it's handled correctly I should have made a career I was mostly speaking to mass immigration I am literally a child of two immigrants it would be pretty famous of me to say that immigration is impossible because it's not you know I brought all this stuff up off hand in a random twitch stream late at night so I understand why people looking at this think I'm some sort of explicit ethno nationalist but but I'm not I genuinely believe this country would be better off if we drop the hyphens and just all refer to each other as fellow Americans and for a number of years now it's been disheartening to me to see this strange road we've been headed down I'd really don't understand it and you know you know some of these topics have really been weighing on me so I felt compelled to respond in some way perhaps against my better judgment I know people don't expect these things from me so in summary you know I'm sorry if this has come out of left field some of you I hope this is cleared up at least a little bit if you were curious what was going on you know any of the things in the stream that could be considered weird sounding or off-putting I probably agree with you that they were so I hope you don't read too much into it that said I genuinely help people keep debating keep talking to each other and keep learning honest civil discourse without which humps is the only way we're getting out of this mess I'd prefer to take a step back now return to doing comedy it's what I do better anyway thank you sincerely to all of you who have supported me through this through this ride I really appreciate it if you'd like to catch up on my new videos you know what if I you,On,Repost

18,PewDiePie,YouTube,"Sep 12, 2017",My Response,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLdxuaxaQwc,Hello. I uh wanted to make a statement on what I said in my previous live-stream You probably won't believe me when I say this but whenever I go online and I hear other players use the same kind of language that I did I always find it extremely immature and stupid and I hate how I now personally fed into that part of gaming as well. It was something that I said in the heat of the moment. I said the worst word I could possibly think of. And it just sort of slipped out. And I'm not gonna make any excuses as to why it did Because there are no excuses for it. I'm disappointed in myself because It seems like I've learned nothing from all these past controversies. And it's not that i think I can say or do whatever I want and get away with it. That's not it at all. I'm just an idiot. But that doesn't make what I said or how I said it okay It was not okay. I'm really sorry if I offended hurt or disappointed anyone with all of this. Being in the position I am I should know better. I know I can't keep messing up like this. And I owe it to my audience and to myself to do better than this because I know I'm better than this. I really want to improve myself and better myself Not just for me but for anyone that looks up to me. Or anyone that's influenced by me. And that's how I want to move forward away from this. That's all I had to say. Thank you for watching. Bye.,On,Original
19,Kevin Spacey,X,"Oct 30, 2017",,https://x.com/KevinSpacey/status/924848412842971136,I have a lot of respect and admiration for Anthony Rapp as an actor. I'm beyond horrified to hear his story. I honestly do not remember the encounter it would have been over 30 years ago. But if I did behave then as he describes I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior and I am sorry for the feelings he describes having carried with him all these years. This story has encouraged me to address other things about my life. I know that there are stories out there about me and that some have been fueled by the fact that I have been so protective of my privacy. As those closest to me know in my life I have had relationships with both men and women. I have loved and had romantic encounters with men throughout my life and I choose now to live as a gay man. I want to deal with this honestly and openly and that starts with examining my own behavior. - Kevin Spacey,On,Original
20,Jenna Marbles,YouTube,"Nov 18, 2017",What Happened To My Fishies Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFwMTG6T_PI,this week for my video I posted a blog of me going to get some fish with my boyfriend Julian and I have since taken that video down and I've seen a lot of people I did write a response on Twitter as to why I was taking you down and there's still a lot of people that are like very confused as to what happened and I first of all I didn't sleep Wednesday through Thursday because this was like it was completely just like destroyed I was like sobbing all day on Thursday I fell asleep last like at like p.m. or something and just woke up so I'm laying in bed this morning and I'm just like how can I make this a teachable moment a fixable moment where I can show people my mistakes so that people don't do it again instead of just taking it down like I'd like to at least be like making this into something where people can have a better idea of what to do in the future and what not to do in the future because I made a mistake and it was my fault and I feel terrible for it and I know a lot of you at least that saw the video when it was up and even now are like this is ridiculous and I totally understand that attitude but to me it's not ridiculous and to I'm sure a lot of people that have fishes pets don't see it as ridiculous so um I guess I just want to like say a couple things about it I think maybe at the end of this I am gonna include the video so you can see what I did and hopefully that will be enough reason for someone to not make that mistake again instead of it just not being on the internet like I'd like to have it be something where you can at least learn what not to do and you know why I made a mistake and you know why other people make mistakes ooh some of the criticism that I had received after I got my hamster add was that I was you know getting a pet like on an impulse on a whim and didn't know enough about them to take care of them and all that was sort of valid except for the fact that like when I'm getting a new pet they're like my family members so maybe I don't have all the most perfect information up front before I get them but I am fully ready and willing and responsible enough to know that I'm going to do anything that I can while they're with me they you know everything that they do in their life is as a result of my effort and I'm going to take care of them to the best of my ability I'm not a person that's gonna go get a pet and then decide like oh you know I really don't want this and then you know get rid of them or give them away and like although the videos do seem very spontaneous of me going and getting a hamster for example I promise you that my level of responsibility is completely there my heart is completely there and as you saw with add although I didn't make like a longer follow-up video with that you saw a look through Julian's vlogs and my snapchat and in the future with that like I will do anything to make sure that you were a happy hamster and I'm sorry that I went to Petco or Pet Smart wherever I went and you know got what was available there to me and that wasn't what was the best friend because Edie serves the best he's my son you can thaw so with the fish from learning from that experience if I'm gonna get a fish I'm going to go to the most you know wonderful fish place I'm gonna get some really good advice I'm gonna get someone that's gonna tell me everything that I need to know and you know really set this up right and make sure that that these fish are like king fish you know I want them to have a great life and a great time while they're in my house it's a small locally privately owned aquarium specific store and they have glowing online reviews about a knowledgeable staff about people that know what they're talking about and I had read a couple of those reviews that were like you know I was a beginner and I went in here and they really helped me so I thought that I was doing these fish a service by getting them from someone that actually cared about where they were gonna go and like yeah all of this again is my fault because it's my job to be informed about the fish and where they should live and how they should live not the person selling them to me and I should have done a better job off the bat by just maybe going in there with an idea of what it what a good first fish first fish for me to have was and you know just educating myself in that level but I didn't I went in there and I was hoping that someone could educate me a complete beginner on fish sort of I mean as an adult a complete beginner and you know help me pick out something that was going to be good for me and my experience with fish in the past has been you know I come from a time in the United States where it wasn't uncommon to win a goldfish at a carnival you know and I think that's part of the whole where oh they're just fish comes from because you know you could win a fish and then we'd go home and put them in a bowl and they might die so people are like oh it's just a fish well you know have a little fishy funeral for him but that's not the case obviously they're living beings they deserve to have a nice environment just like anybody else and I had had some successful fish when I was a little older I had goldfish and you know I was like I think I understand what it takes to have a fish and you know even if it's far more intensive than that I'm willing to do that because I'm an adult now and I'd like to have some fish I think it'd be great so it wasn't my lack of wanting to have them or wanting to take care of them it was my lack of information going in so that I could preemptively make sure that they had a good place to live for [ __ ] sake sorry that camera just died so anyways I went into a nice specialty fish store and I was hoping they could set me up a fish appropriate for my skill level and a tank appropriate for my skill level and I was really counting on that person to help me their expertise because you know it's not like I had never been exposed to any fish things in the world I had in the past as a younger person and I had as an adult sort of a little bit you know like I know that I don't want a saltwater fish or a shark or something that needs a hundred gallon tank you know I would like something small and you know that I can take care of without being a fish expert and that if I would like to continue to move into that hobby that I can grow and learn and you know expand my knowledge like that so I was really counting on this person to recommend something to me rather than me going in there with a certain set of ideas about you know what I thought was good for me as a beginner so as you'll see in the video it shows us going in there and the guy had said - I don't I want to disclose the place I mean maybe in the future I will if people are curious but they did really have really nice reviews and I'm not trying to blow up their spot really like I'm not trying to say you know these people did this to me you know [ __ ] then like I don't I don't really know some people might have a really great experience with them maybe they are really great I don't know but this was my experience and I'm not trying to like drag them personally but I went in and he told me to pick a tank size first and then we'll work that way in order to pick a fish that's appropriate for that and appropriate for my skill level because I was like you know I know I don't know anything and you know I'm new to having a fish and I need something for like a beginner and you know he explained to me the larger the tank the easier it is to clean and that you know we should get the largest tank that we can feasibly get and you know work that way so you'll see in the videos that he recommended a circular tank to me although it looks kind of small in the video it is 8 gallons you know it's not super tiny and a lot of people were saying to me you know the general rule is like one gallon per fish basically or one to two depending on what the fish are and the the fish that he told me to get were we gave me a bunch of options the one so we decided we're petrol Barb's or Barb's so basically they'll grow to like two or three inches maybe and so yeah they might eventually grow out of that but you know he didn't explain that to me but in theory yes that was enough space for them just based on that but I have since learned when I posted this video because it's a really cool tank there's you know LED lights and like bubbles and stuff it's rad but that the circular tanks are illegal in some countries because it's seen as cruel so they basically just like swim around I think there's predators there distorts their vision like it's not good for them and obviously I would have never bought a circular tank if I had known that but you know again this is my fault for going in there and not knowing that and it also is kind of discouraging to me that we in America would even sell that as an option if it's not good for a fish and you know I got a lot of comments from people being like I have a bio our butts really great like this is ridiculous like don't worry about it but like if there's any question like how hard is it to get a rectangle tank not hard for me you know what I mean like who cares and also again the bubble the center filtration there I did he did get me to get a heater in there a thermometer so that the temperature was correct and all of that but someone had told me in the comments of my video that the center bubble column it sort of ends like right here and that there was a power outage one time and he had a betta fish in there in the same size as mine which is in the comments I read probably appropriate for maybe one betta fish maybe and the power went out and his betta fish swam like into that and like basically killed itself so I live in Southern California do you guys have seen when we have like blackouts and stuff it's like it happens too often for me to not consider that as something to be really worried about I don't want my fish to kill themselves so like [ __ ] no I'd rather have something from the top or they can't just swim in there like [ __ ] man like come on dude help me out here I don't want my [ __ ] today we picked that tank because he had suggested to get the biggest size tank that we could but I was like you know I don't I'm not gonna get a 50 gallon tank like you know I'd like something that could fit on a tabletop and have you know maybe I was thinking going in there I was like give one fish and like having these thing you know I I don't know like you tell me I need some help and do we pick that tank and there was no like you know you should get a rectangular tank or you know there was no discussion it was like these are probably good it's like a whole set up for like be a nurse you know they got everything you need in there just get this guy and then all right over here we got some some Barb's some you know he threw out tetras air tetras our different fish and you know all these other like walked us down and I was like here's all the freshwater fish and you know these are some good ones that you can start off with and I'm like okay and then I was like I don't know what to put in here like is there gravel he's like it comes with gravel and then he pointed me to like the bio where he was like these are probably the nicest you know decorations you should put in there and so he sold us on like a actual box full of all that stuff that you saw it was like okay cool and he explained to me sort of the cycle you know that we should wait as long as we can to introduce them into the water where is now I realized that this needed to be done like a month ahead of time because the the fish need if you guys want to do research if you ever would like a fish you know check out Taylor Nicole Dean who's been a blessing to me in the aftermath of this I it's really invaluable to have her opinion and thoughts it's like the mistake I made when I was younger when you would win a goldfish unfair and you're like dad help me set it up and you know you put him in a nice bowl and he dies like you can't just put a fish into some water even with conditioner even with the biological whatever because they they need it to be the pH balanced the ammonia the nitrates and all this stuff needs to be right for them to live in and you know he did sort of make it sound to me that by adding these things to the water and letting it set up for a while and adding their water and that it was gonna be OK for them and it's not it's not okay I'm upset that I trusted someone else's expertise it seems silly to go into a place where you're like I believe that you're trying to help me and like Wikipedia everything that he's saying to me on my own and be like actually get thought but basically the the little barbs that he then recommended to go into that tank you know they're like their school fish they like to be in a school they like to be with their friends and they need like a nice long like at least thirty gallon tank to swim back and forth and like have a good time with their buddies and had I known that I would have never put them into a circular tank alone basically after I uploaded the video to where a lot of people you know this is their experience as well is you go into a place you have some knowledge not really obviously the best knowledge or enough knowledge but you do have some knowledge or experience and you know you take someone else's word in good faith and you come home and you do the best that you can and you obviously want your fish to have a wonderful environment you want to see your fish being like this is [ __ ] great I'm having a great time nobody wants to see their fish be like wow this sucks I hate millet opposed to the video and I started getting feedback obviously of like first first and foremost no circle tank don't do that and I'm like [ __ ] okay that's something I can fix I can fix that I can get them a bigger tank no problem second like those plastic plants in there like that's not good for them like they need natural plants obviously like their natural environment okay [ __ ] all right let me fix that I can do that I can work on that the filter obviously the person telling me the power going out going in there [ __ ] ok let's get rid of this tank and then people you know telling me he shouldn't have sold you those Barb's you know they they need a a big 30 gallon tank there they're gonna grow it be a couple inches they need more space than that and I'm like [ __ ] ok I'll do anything I'll do anything that it takes and then as I started to look more and more into it I realized like basically my fish are suffering right now so because there's no established like cycled system in there basically when they poop in pee they create ammonia and then they're supposed to be a good level of bacteria in that tank already that eats that ammonia so to fish cycle the tank you know it takes a little while for those fish to live in there and some might die which is what he was explaining to me and like that's just part of the system but since the fish community has sort of made their way around that and have created a fishless cycle for their tanks so that they don't have to have little fish that live in an awful environment and die in order to get your tank ready for fish to live in it that's one thing that I am really grateful to the fish community on YouTube and the Internet as well is that instead of people giving me feedback that was making me feel like some monster for following the directions of someone that didn't necessarily have my or the fish's best interest at heart they were normalizing my experience and genuinely trying to help me moving forward what is the best thing to do for these fish and I really appreciate that and I already felt horrible enough as it is once I realized that I had made a mistake and what doesn't help is when people are like [ __ ] you for doing this you're a piece of [ __ ] like this was an honest mistake and I am really sorry to the fish I am sorry to anyone that thinks that they should do this or like I I sat with the guilt of the fact that I have a in the other room a tank full of fish that don't deserve to be in that environment and you know I thought I was do something fun and happy and it wasn't thanked for [ __ ] sake it sucks it doesn't help when someone reminds you that you're a terrible person it feels bad man so I genuinely appreciate that people were you know not only trying to help me but they were normalizing this as you know before I became a fish expert I did the same thing and I had fish die and it really sucks and it feels terrible and you know it's something that people do go through not because they want to but because sometimes this is the information that is you know available to us and at this point with the internet this is my fault there is no excuse I should have done this beforehand I should have had a tank doing its thing for a month so that I can introduce some fish in a safe way this is my fault so after I uploaded the video it did reach out to Taylor who by the way if you are looking to get a fish hurt and there's a bunch of other channels solid-gold aquatics is the other girl that commented on my channel but there's like there's a really rad fish community on YouTube and I of course found them all after the fact and Taylor Nicole Dean by the way as everything was sort of going on I fell down a serious cheese hole which is cheese as one of her fish and now I'm emotionally invested in cheese but I just I really appreciate that the fish community sort of was like okay Jenna you know you sort of [ __ ] up but like here's what you can do now and I did I asked Taylor at DM Taylor on Twitter I need to know now that I've done this what is the most ethical thing for me to do at this point now that the fish are in a environment that's you know not balanced for them ready it's not ready yet do I leave them in there do I continue to let them sort of like help the tank go through this natural cycle do I move them into a bigger tank and you know have them do it in there do I give them back to the pet store because you know it's sort of unethical to leave them in that day and Taylor gave me a couple of options I want to just tell you from my perspective and why why I got here I didn't want to leave the fish in that tank and most of the information that was you know being bestowed upon me was that you know you change 25% in the water every single day so that the ammonia buildup in there isn't enough to like harm them and totally willing to do that no problem but it felt wrong like those fish are basically in there with not good bacteria it's not great it's the wrong shape the wrong size they're not having a good time there's no natural plants bad time bad time all around bad water bad fun bad time and to move them into another tank with even more water and even more space and not natural plants than there's like you know I'm just asking them to do that process on an even bigger scale and now an even more stressful scale and to me the most ethical thing to do was to get them out of the environment that I had put them in immediately and to get them back into water that was safe for them into an environment that wasn't gonna hurt them like the plastic plants no good for them they're gonna cut their little fins on there no fun they don't like them there to me there was no other option like yes I could go into that room and change 25% in the water every day hoping that they're gonna live through it and hoping that everything's gonna be okay and I can cycle my tank but I just I literally could not look at them being like yeah I hope you live it's like no [ __ ] no I want to get you out of here so that you can be in a place that's good for you I put you in a bad environment that is my fault not yours why should you have to suffer the consequences of my bad decision do you know I'm saying that's what it felt like to me so although I know some of you are probably like you know you could have fixed the tank it's not a big deal you know just let them live but to me it's like I put my fish and I'm in a bad place so I'm gonna make it right and I'm gonna put them in the right place so we brought the fish back to the place that I got them and I was like you know I want to talk to the guy that sold me these fish and told me that this was a good environment for them and told me what to do I want to tell him you know hey man I double-checked and it turns out everything you told me was kind of [ __ ] and so I went in there being like it took a while to get our fish used safely into a bag so we could bring them back and it was really hard to like do that because I was now emotionally attached to them I love them I want them to be happy but knowing that I was doing something that was ultimately right for them and gonna help them and I wasn't gonna make them suffer through a new cycle process they didn't deserve that so I went in there being like I'm gonna tell this guy like hey man [ __ ] you and I went in there I've been crying all day and I went in there and I was like I have to give these fish back to you like I don't want my money back and I want man I just I had to get back to it I just started crying like a baby and he was like what's wrong can I give you credit like you know and I was like these fish don't you guys sir told me in a circle tank and you said that was okay with plastic plants and a filter that they could in theory get into and you guys you said that that was right and these fish you know they act like crying they'd grow to be like a couple inches and they need to be in a school and they need to swim back and forth and they needed like you know have other fish there eventually and he was like yeah there's a lot of bad information online isn't there you know and I was like so confused because clearly the information that people were giving me was like a resounding no circle tanks like those fish need to be in a 30 gallon tank that you they need to be in a school and that here's this guy the expert that's telling me that all of that was misinformation and I just got like really discouraged you know like you're the person selling them when everyone else in the fish community is saying that this is what the fish need what the [ __ ] man what the [ __ ] he was like they're fine it was fine and I'm like no it's not fine I was like I just I want you to take it back and I want you to put them back in the tank so you know they can be in a environment that's safe for them and where they don't they're not gonna die because I'm stupid it sort of just made me realize like obviously I care about fish obviously I care about other living beings I literally don't eat animals like I care I care about my pets I want them to be happy yeah those fish could have lived in that tank just fine and everyone that had told me that is totally right the you know we can make it work so they can live in there and that's fine but an analogy I think that helps me understand is like with my dogs or dogs in general is like yeah a German Shepherd could live in a one-bedroom apartment and spend eight hours a day in a crate and survive but it's alright for him you know it's not the place that he should be and if you care about that dog you you wouldn't make him do that just because you love him and you want him to like be with you you know so I wanted to do right by those animals and this whole thing's been a really big learning experience for me obviously and that's I guess that's my biggest takeaway is that I would have loved to have provided a fish or a couple of fish a really lovely environment it's not that I'm unprepared once I get them to take care of them and do everything that it takes I had just failed them in the beginning by not having an environment ready for them and my only option after this point was to just make sure that they were in a safe environment so in the future when you're like Jenna where's your fish they're not here I brought them to a place where they'd be better off and you know someday if I decide that I'm not completely scarred by this experience because it has been kind of traumatic for me that if I would like to you know get a fish so that I would I would like to make sure that I do it the right way and that there's an environment appropriate for them before they even come in so obviously this is like it's pretty awful for me to post it's like pretty it's like tearing you up inside obviously like I don't I don't want to put my video up but I want this to be something that maybe not only normalizes your experience or you know prevents anyone in the future from making this mistake with fish in particular because people's attitudes about fish is a lot like what that guy's is is like you know whatever [ __ ] and they'll just well they're fine their fish whatever but to me it was like I feel powerful I just want to [ __ ] crawl in a hole and die today like I can't believe that I did this I feel terrible I am gonna put the video up so you can see a step-by-step tutorial of how not to get a fish and how to set up their environment completely wrong and I'm gonna link some channels in the description that have some good information about fish some solid information about fish if you're curious about doing this and you don't want to make the same mistake that I did and even though it hurts me and it's embarrassing and I feel literally [ __ ] awful I'm trying to make this into a positive thing and at least prevent someone else from seeing my video and being like all that circle thanks cool I want to go get one even if this is it my expense like I feel [ __ ] terrible I don't think I could feel worse at this point but like I want to just make sure that no one else does that and then has to feel like that because it's it really sucks man and I want to say thank you to the fish community you guys are really kind and thoughtful and you made me feel like I wasn't alone that this is a common mistake and that you know sometimes people that work in these stores this is a thing that they do they sell you a fish that's going to need a bigger and bye and you know they make it they set you up to fail so that your fish die and you come in with a million questions to keep buying more fish and bigger fish and with bigger spaces so they set you up in this like you know they're like getting you addicted to drugs basically it's like yeah I'll sell you this crack and then eventually you're gonna need a crack cave you know what I'm saying if there's something that you do take away from the video I hope that you see how like genuine I am and that like I just want some fish that have a nice place to live and then I didn't do this out of any malice or with any intentions other than like I'd like to have some fish you know they're great they're cool I want them to live in my house and I am prepared to take care of them and do everything that they need but right now I done [ __ ] up and you know did this wrong I hope I've done enough here to make sure again that you know this is not what you should do and if you want to know what to do there's lots of resources please if you ever have a friend or anybody that's like I want to get a fish make sure that you like point them in a good direction yeah this sucks I'm so incredibly sorry and I hope that I did enough for the the fishies to get them back into a better environment so that they did not have to sight painfully cycle a tank themselves a tank that wasn't right the wrong size the wrong shape with no natural fun [ __ ] plants in there for them like nothing fun in there for them and in the future if I choose to do this I will gladly and happily make a video about the right way to do it so for those of you that are like this is stupid and like way too extra I apologize but to a lot of people it's not and to me it's not and these are living breathing beings and I just want them to have a good life and I [ __ ] up I'm really sorry I hope that this is like enough to prevent anyone else from doing this and know that I feel really really terrible about it and that's you know that's it and it's not like with the fish it wasn't like adware it was like oh my god I'll fix it right away it was like no there they're gonna continue to suffer because of my bad choice and you got to make it right right now like you can't just get him a bigger tank so I mean as much as I wanted to continue to give the fish a bigger and better and amazing fun environment for them like it would have required them to suffer through that and I'm just I wouldn't be able to like go to sleep at night honestly I can't here's the video it's a step-by-step tutorial of what not to do if you would like to get a fish most of the video is just me being annoyed Julian so take that for what it is but here is the video this is what happened to the video I hope you understand I am incredibly sorry it did not mean to disappoint anybody or make anyone mad or do wrong by any animals so again I really apologize and I hope that if you're looking into getting some fishies just don't do what I did just don't do don't do it there you go I will see you next week okay harder oh I didn't say it I'm gonna get some fish sheets I don't know just like up maybe like got nothing no salt water maybe was like a freshwater guy like he'll be easy and little what I don't know see I don't know that much about fish I haven't had one since I was younger I had two goldfish but then one of them like ate the other one it does why are you thinking that for I don't know what could go well I don't get to feel bad sometimes I feed out everything I know well we feed him at the same time is add just a little sprinkle here fish photo well sprinkle adds seeds and nuts somewhere where if there's an earthquake he's gonna be all gay fun really you don't seem excited no do I get to name it that's the compromise you can name it no one's gonna want to dog-sit anymore because they have to see the zoo so I assume is this my sanctuary this was your reaction when I asked for added now he's like your actual best friend in the world you hurt it we're going to get a new friend listen okay hear me out I know a lot of you are like Jenna you have so many animals you can't just keep acquiring animals I woke up today wanting to do one of two things I either wanted to absolutely decorate the [ __ ] out of my house with Christmas decorations and even I recognized my too much gene and was like Thanksgiving hasn't even happened yet it's not okay or acquire a new friend for our family I know we joke about my age all the time that I'm like 31 and have a basketball game MA which is all very true also a Virgo I'm also never wrong but like I feel like I'm at the age where all I want to do is just mother something to death and I read a comment recently and on one of our hamster videos that was like I can't wait to see what animal Jenna gets next so she can mother it to death which is so completely true but I really like Jillian I do want to have kids but like we need a couple of things before we get there it's like overwhelming so I was like what kind of pet can we get because you know even a mammal is probably too much even a bird is probably too much I'm being realistic here we could get a little fishy guy I asked Julian prairie cat just about every day and Julian says no so I feel like a Fisher is a good compromise yeah it is I can't have plants they'll all die I never like that's what my mothering too much gene is like too much I either just like trench them and drown them I did it we're gonna get a fishy guy I don't know what kind they're converting one and I need something that's at least gonna survive with my basketball game tomorrow we're coming Plus her do you play pub gee well that guy's a big one what's your favorite sub n it your tank when you buy it your tank in one week can you get me a free life on HQ please do play HQ I like him I like him a lot you look like ad they make it looks like a boy I know these guys are like really connecting with me right now we finish it off we have not picked out the fish school penta Barb's he said five or six the one we're gonna think of are at the bar thank you give me a name of all the bars yeah they like to hang out little school and they're gonna miss their friends it's gone dark okay we had a lot of learning to do but that guy was so helpful okay he was really really really helpful he made sure that we got fishies that were good - like establish an ecosystem in there and like weren't gonna fight each other we got five right not six by five tetra barbs is that what they felt at your bar named after barb from strange I think we got five bars y'all this is some real justice survive the only barb so we're gonna take them home they're gonna have a lot of time to chill out while we get their tank ready so that we make sure we have the right setup for them and Julian will name them all are you excited yeah they look I'm so excited I think it's gonna be such a nice little addition to our family to the no bars permits very curious he just jumped on the table and almost stepped on their bag this is like a nice solid surface yeah if there's an earthquake what we don't know is that tetra bombs to go flying I know used to wash everything look at this terrifying picture do not place in direct sunlight because it can concentrate light rays can cause a fire I like farms but I also don't want to catch it on fire very informative to my Aries partner Julian disconnect the power before you ever reach into the water okay Julian never carry or pull the unit by the electrical cable are you listening Julian we got this really nice selection of things since they're freshwater fish we chose that on my cell fresh watery selection of things except you taught us one except for this because Julian insisted on getting this does that have a name yeah okay we will ask you Carl let's spell coral you excited yeah Julian you just mushroom don't Ares this up okay I kind of want to live in there stop being nasty the heater and thermometer back there I cannot get this [ __ ] ball to stay down oh my god we're gonna do a half a cap of that so that it gets nice and ready we're gonna make sure the temperature is good do some biological booster to add some bacterial cultures in there that's all for that stupid ball give up on the ball I'm a good fish parent kill the boost I think we did it this is [ __ ] amazing I want it to be red I don't want it to be green now I want it to be blue the statue isn't centered it's charged oh my god do you know them [ __ ] it just so you can strengthen the statue Oh our so we're gonna let this run for a little while make sure it's the right temperature we'll see you in a little while here at the barbs they're so cute they poop in their water a bunch they've just been hanging out try and get your water in here with the new water so you can start feel look it they're like let us out already so they're gonna acclimate and just kind of like stay still for a while so this has been going for quite a while now the guy at the fish store did say to let it cycle for 24 hours and I was like is it possible to do it at all today and he said yeah but there is a chance that you know they're not gonna acclimate well and they might die but that they might also do that after 24 hours because they're new fishing and you take so I mean I'm a little concerned because the Wonka bars to live certainly doesn't been 24 hours but like we've been having the tank go for quite some time put a little bit of the tank water in with their water this seems so extras no they'll die either way he did prepare me but anytime you're starting a new tank some fish might die so I'm really pulling for all of our barbs and we're trying our best here please if you're on the Internet and your fish care elitist know that I have not had a fish since I was a child I'm trying my best just like with ad like if I make some mistakes in the comments you can try and help me understand but know that I want the best for my fish I really do I'm not trying to do anything wrong but if I do don't yell at me okay I have a lot of things some other page up do you want to see the fishies I'm trying to wait like as long as possible to put them in well you got a lab full shrimpy fella which which one they all look the same guy on the left bottom left right there shrimpy one looking up the Apple TV that's Apple TV no please do not name him Apple TV Rick Astley before Giuliana top

Apple TV is very versed in Spanish he's a spanish-speaking fish okay sign language American Sign Language does American and there's Canadian sign language in South America it's an entirely different game have you talked to anyone in Canada lately you just think it sings rock and roll or knows those fish ships they're stunning probably my five sons yes they're all boys it's a girl Stanford Ashley

like electric right away I love how they all swim together for the Gucci game okay you know what we're not gonna do it's call them that it's finally time bud what do you think so it is much later ad is now an awake good morning baby the fish are sort of like they're really enjoying all of their plants and stuff they're hiding a little bit they're like a little skittish and they keep hiding down in there it's okay you don't have to come out y'all can hide in there for a little while until you feel ready the end of this video isn't very exciting because they're just in there hanging out

21,Shay Carl,Youtube,"Dec 6, 2017",Body Language: Shay Carl Caught Cheating: RE: i'm sorry,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_S_1I7mMHrU&list=PLqkz-pvmNGHOl3Kw_quVf3v9PyNH4cTJL&index=22,okay i've been wanting to make this video for a long time and i have really lacked the courage i've been terrified i normally tend to like youtubers that make short and sweet emotional apology videos now i don't know anything about shea carl but this was something that a viewer suggested i look into so i decided to apparently shay carl cheated on his wife and he's a part of one of the most popular family channels on youtube so you can imagine how that came as a huge surprise to a lot of his viewers now just by reading the comments you can tell 100 percent no one is buying into this man's [ __ ] i mean he cheated on his wife and they have three kids together forgive me if i'm wrong but three [ __ ] kids together i haven't seen this video yet so this is gonna be my first playthrough of it but basically i'm just gonna watch it it's only a five minute video so it's not too too bad i'm gonna watch it and break down his body language and just tell you guys what i think i've been so ashamed now i don't want to jump to conclusions too soon but within the first couple of seconds of that clip there's already a body movement that gives them away in a sense so he's looking into the emotional side of his brain whenever he says i'm ashamed but then not even a [ __ ] nano second later he's shaking his head no i've been so ashamed now i don't know about you guys but i've been in some deep [ __ ] before some situations where someone has confronted me and i've done something that i'm not proud of and all i can do is sit there and stare off into the distance because i know how badly i [ __ ] up and then once you realize that there is literally nothing you could have done to change that in that moment you start shaking your head because you're [ __ ] but the point i'm trying to make here is that whenever you have that kind of moment of realization that you're [ __ ] it takes a minute or two to get to that before you can start shaking your head you have to have some kind of moment of introspection to come to that conclusion because human beings naturally want to defend themselves that's what they want to do there's no way that shay carl could have made this off-the-cuff apology and had that moment instantly and i know he'd been saying that he had stood over this for a while because he was scared to make the video but the thing is that this is in his car this was filmed on a random [ __ ] day like he did not plan this out this wasn't a 40-minute long video you know this was a five-minute long video like hey sorry i [ __ ] up yo so my guess immediately i know i said i didn't want to jump to conclusions and here i am you're saying that you spent so much time thinking about this i don't think you did i'm gonna go ahead and call it right now for the rest of this video but i think the only thing that this guy thought of is how to act like he cared i'll have to apologize i need to take a breath but honestly i'm this mad because there's kids involved he shouldn't have done this but whatever embarrassed disgusted and just scared i want to apologize now this movement that he does here the stroking of his beard it goes on for an awkward amount of time you know he says i want to apologize and then sits there and scratches his [ __ ] beard for like 20 seconds this is his way of indirectly planning out what he's about to say you know instead of making the eye movement scanning the constructive part of his brain he just sits there and self-soothes he's in deep thought but he shows it with that hand movement so i'm just gonna take a wild guess and say that the next thing that comes out of his mouth is gonna be [ __ ] i wanna say i'm sorry to my wife my kids my family you see i'm kind of torn because he's saying sorry to his wife and his kids but by addressing them initially he doesn't show any emotion i have no clue what he's going to say next but it's like come on man this is your wife and your kids why are you just staring down the camera i don't want to say sorry to all of you oh now it makes sense so he he goes directly into emotion after saying he wants to say sorry to his viewers makes sense a lot of people say i don't owe anybody an apology you see how his head just goes straight into his shoulder he's lying he knows he's lying he's a pretty good actor though in this particular instance because um can you guys name a single person that told him he didn't have to apologize for [ __ ] cheating on his wife but i do and i want to take responsibility for my actions for the choices that i made that brought pain and embarrassment and shame to me and my loved ones hello my name is shay carl i know i [ __ ] up big time and my family hates me i can't even keep a straight face while saying this apology because i'm lying hardcore nah but for real man he has a [ __ ] smirk on his face the entire time he says that it is so dramatic why are you being so dramatic this is supposed to be a serious thing you just [ __ ] over your entire family three [ __ ] kids not because i have an alcoholism problem and there's that stupid false emotion head shake again i'm not justifying anything i did or said i'm not asking for forgiveness i don't know if god's forgiven me i don't even think my wife's been able to forgive me yet but i have to forgive myself but i have to forgive myself yeah no guys i really thought i could make it through this five minute video but that is just proving to be really [ __ ] hard for me right now cause he's fake crying and everyone [ __ ] knows it do i really need to keep going with this oh my god or i will destroy myself i hate myself for the pain that i caused my angel of a wife the embarrassment the public humiliation i'm just gonna breathe in a lot and just wave my head around because that's what crying people do yeah i'm really gonna regret making these audio clips in a couple of days i'm tired of hiding from it i'm tired of feeling like this and i'm not saying i don't deserve it i'm not saying i wasn't wrong i take full responsibility i fell to my the natural man the carnal sensual and devilish part of me that exists that i have to fight against every day the path of least resistance this tilts towards the telestial that constantly nags at my soul and pulls me to something in some place i don't want to be i'm not perfect i'm not perfect i've never said i was perfect i've fought to stay happy i still believe that happiness is a choice i believe that my choices have caused me much unhappiness and if i will just choose better i will find joy through good choices you know what's interesting after watching this i think shay carl is purposefully trying not to look to his left i think he knew eventually that someone was going to make a body language analysis video on his so because when you think about it objectively whether you're lying or not your eyes are going to dance they're going to go all over the place but i see him physically stopping himself from looking to the left he's really got this [ __ ] memorized like he has studied this script i believe in families i believe my family is the most important thing in the world to me i don't care about youtube i don't care about fame or money i don't care about scalable businesses okay okay all right [ __ ] me then but honestly this this was planned out this this little dramatic turn to his left yeah that's that's definitely planned out to the t i care about my wife and kids to me we are eternal and the things that matter the most last the longest and i believe that families are forever that is that is my biggest hope that is the one thing that i care about is that i can exist with them after this body dies okay i'm really really sorry i have to stop this abruptly i i just can't anymore i can't there's like what three more minutes left of this video i just i can't i can't i can't i can't he's lying that's very clear c thank you for watching this video,On,Repost

23,Jake Dufner,YouTube,"May 24, 2018",I'm Alive and I Can Explain... (The Truth) (youtube.com),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQncGfdEOnQ,now for the people still watching it's time for you to be creative what if I did go missing by the killer he kidnapped me took my clothes and murdered someone to make it look like he murdered me but this whole time he was holding me hostage waiting for the cops to come to set me up under the mask and now that killer is running free right now and plotting his next his next move be creative be open-minded allow yourself to make the movies your mind creates so I didn't want to make this video at all but it's kind of a necessity and everybody watching this right now before this video before I even start talking because I mean I tried to make this video like 14 times been doing this all day but there's just so much to say and so much to talk about so much to explain and my mind just goes too crazy to be able to get everything on the table without like going off on tangents or completely messing up my word so bear with me this may be a long video but if you are watching this I want you all every single one of you that are watching this right now whether you're a huge fan of me whether you hate my guts whatever you are just I need every single one of you before this video starts consuming a huge favor and take your biasness and wipe it clean I want every single buddy that's watching this right now to be completely open-minded and not have opinions until you hear everything that had to say because it's just this went so spiral out of control and I need to explain myself and there's a lot of different points to be explaining and I'm completely open minded I understand if you're a fan and you're upset with me if you're a mad at me and you're a fan if you're like ah what the heck you know blah blah blah you that's that's messed up don't do that I understand that I understand those comments but let me explain what happened I can explain all this but it's just super hard for me to do so just watch the whole video and you won't be as ignorant because I'm getting a lot of lot a lot of ignorant comments that don't even know what they're talking about because what happened was when I first started uploading this series yes series guys I don't okay I am the fur that is the furthest thing away from prank people that are saying prank furthest thing away from it it is not a prank it was nowhere ever intended to be a prank so get the word prank and throw it or flick it as far as you possibly could because this all of this was not a prank and it was not me faking my death that wasn't it at all and what happened was after that video that I posted it's called he's dead I will link everything to the underneath the description or you can just go to my channel and check it out but it was titled she's dead and pretty much my series was there was a stalker crazy fan and more of the story is I went to go meet him and he slaughtered me on camera and 50% of my fans thought bro this was so awesome bro this video was so sick Jake you're a legend this is so creative is so entertaining blah blah you're lit blah blah blah that's 50% of the comments and the other 50% we're like you know the innocent little fans that are just like oh I hope you're okay blah blah blah and then there was like that that like 2% of people that saw that video that just took it completely out of control you know that we're making reaction videos on it like Jake Dauphin is dead this that and every single time I saw a video being uploaded talking about me being dead I cringed so hard I was like why why is this happening and not that like you know it's their fault for making that video because I know it's something crazy that happened and if you do think that you know I'm dead then of course you can make a reaction video like a youtuber just died but oh man I just bear with me because it's it's getting it's gonna get deep and pretty much people were coming to my channel to only see that video they're not they didn't they don't understand what's going on they don't okay it was like a 10 video series i uploaded like 10 videos in one week and they only seen that one video so i mean i'm i understand where you're coming from trust me I'm being completely open-minded just like you guys watching this are gonna be as open-minded as possible I understand where you're coming from if you came to my channel and you saw that video and that's the only video you saw then I understand why you can be like oh my god Jake Duncan is dead and make a video about it or go on Instagram and be like you'll rest in peace Jake Duffner this that I understand that and then after a few hours go by I guess people brought it over to other social media and not just YouTube and I mean I do that all the time you guys know that if you're a fan of me and you've been watching me for this amount of time then you know that I always kind of interact Instagram and YouTube together because it allows me to be closer with you guys and explain what's going on and you know just talk to you guys interact with you guys so I'm always like going back forth on Instagram and YouTube so I understand people coming over my Instagram but then what started happening was people were putting my death on Instagram people that you know are completely irrelevant to the whole situation and then I was getting flooded on my Instagram of people like oh my god rest in peace and then people that don't even know who I am we're coming to my page and seeing that everybody was saying rest in peace and then they were like why they saying that and then they would see the video and only that video and they're being like wow this kids a scumbag he's faking his death for publicity and that is not what I did I did not fake my death for publicity even though I understand once again where you guys are coming from it once again I'm being open-minded I understand where those people are coming from like wow this kids a scumbag he's faking his death for publicity because you saw someone posting on Instagram rest in peace Jake Duff and then you went to go do more research and found that video and you're like wow this video is entertaining but it's a complete lie and it's not a lie first of all it's not fake it's not a lie it's not a prank get all three of those words and shove them so far into the nearest person to your left ass because that's not what it is it is not a prank it is not fake and what it is is simply acting it's acting it is being creative and if you want to be on YouTube if you're scrolling through YouTube and you don't want entertaining videos if you don't want someone that is putting hard work into their videos then this is not the channel for you because I have 400000 duffy's 400000 fans that that joined my journey just because of my personality just because I was funny and outgoing and I love you guys so much like that honestly blows my mind that I'm at 400000 subscribers of just me and my friends joking around messing around and that's amazing like I could have kept going I could have just been I was growing slowly I could have kept doing that and I could have been like you know this is awesome people are loving me from a personality but one thing that you guys never knew of me and that I wanted to show very badly it was that I am one of the most creative people that most people have met when I was growing up I remember being like 10 11 12 years old and I remember just in everyday life I would I would do things here and there that I don't know how to explain it maybe I'll give an example okay one time I was like 10 11 years old once again and I was in the bathtub or I was in the shower I don't know I said bathtub and the door was open and I knew that my brother was out there talking on mom or doing something and in the hallway where you can see into my into the door you can't see into the shower but you can see like you know the showers like right behind the wall and there's a door so you see if I'm coming in and out of shower you don't see me in the shower and I knew who's out there so what I did was I slipped on purpose and fell out of the shower and I didn't make myself seem like I had a concussion or anything I kind of just fell and got up and I was like whoops and I hopped back in the shower and my brother was cracking you up he said it was the funniest thing he's ever seen in his entire life and then when I told him like hey I did it on purpose like I did that just to make you laugh and it was a complete lie like I did it on purpose didn't believe me at all he was like yeah okay bro that that was you fell out of your shower I guess the moral of that story is that when I do things and then people it just gave me some type of satisfaction I don't know it gave me some some type of satisfaction that like wow I was creative enough and I acted well enough to make him believe that that just happened and my whole life growing up my friends will tell me bro you have a mind that can literally make movies like people would tell me Joe Aaron every sick like every one of my friends would tell me bro you need to be in studio directing movies because like your mind no one else is thinking of that stuff and the fact that you know other people might think of the stuff that I'm thinking of but they won't be able to execute it you know like they will just be like oh I'm a gendarme a kit logical to make it as if it will actually happen like the most insane thing you can possibly think of I will make it down into steps and I will make it a logical and that's kind of like what I wanted to do I have four hundred thousand subscribers that love me for who I am and I think that it was time for me to show who I could be and it was not a prank I don't want any of you guys to think that you know I was pranking the subscribers because that is not what I was doing it was not a prank I'm seeing so many people say you know this is a messed up prank I still love you though but it was a messed up printing so say sorry and I guess it's a video of me saying sorry if you thought it was a prank but it wasn't it's more of a video of me explaining myself of you know what was going on because people took it in the complete wrong way and I mean people are like you're faking your death reviews because you can't do anything else well that is probably one of the most ignorant comments that someone can write down below is like you know you're faking your death for views your shitty youtuber you're not creative because you had a fake your death reviews doesn't make sense to me because obviously I was creative enough to make you believe that I just faked my death so I mean you kind of just like twisted your own words there and ate your own words but I don't know if you want boring vlogs if okay so every youtuber right now is riding a wave if you're at a million subscribers 2 million subscribers whatever you're at I don't know and I'm not hating once again I'm being very open-minded there riding waves they'd see something do well this is what youtubers do they see something do well on the explore page or a recommended page and they're like wow this person did pretty good on it let me kind of do the same thing only in my perspective and that's what every youtuber does and literally if you click on a video then the recommended will be 700 videos of the same exact thing but a different creator posting it am I wrong no I'm not wrong that's what happens just like on you know the video that I posted there's like a million videos underneath about Jake deafness death so what I'm saying is I don't want to I don't want to flood YouTube with stuff that people are already seeing you can't get this entertainment this creativeness anywhere else and I'm sure of it yes people are creative I'm not saying you guys aren't creative but people don't have the balls enough or don't have the work ethic enough and I can say you don't have work ethic because that's not an insult that's you know maybe a reality check like you know work for what you have you have whatever a million two million three million four million five million subscribers and you're just you know riding waves and you're gonna max out because you'd only get to so many people until people realize like hey you're just like doing the same exact thing everybody else is doing and I want to separate myself my channel from all of that I want to be known for me my creativeness I want to be known as the kid that no one else can do it like you know and once again it wasn't me faking my death it wasn't me pranking my subscribers it was simply me making a series and being creative enough to where you guys would be glued to the screen that you're watching I wanted you guys to be glued and I've been thinking about doing crazy stuff like this for a while now and to the fact that you guys think that I was already created for the ones that do you think you know you're a legend for this this was nuts you guys don't even understand a fraction of this brain up here I had I had months of videos planned out of what was gonna happen and I was gonna make them happen it was gonna go way more in-depth way more into a storyline it was gonna be it was gonna be crazy like literally nuts something that you would see in movies and I couldn't go any further because once again it spiraled out of control and it went on to other social media of people thinking I was actually dead and or faking my death so I had a bunch of fans saying you know this is messed up or that they're gonna hurt themselves and once I started hearing that that people are gonna hurt themselves over me and after crying over me and this that I was like damn I can't go any further with this series because I can't risk any of my fans hurting themselves over it so I started uploading like two videos in one day like multiple times I was uploading as fast as possible because I couldn't just go out and tweet got it don't listen I can't tweet that or I just say it on a video because you guys would not understand at all and this was like the only logical way I can think of explaining for you guys I had to rush a finale as fast as possible that wasn't the finality that I originally planned once again I had a million videos planned up that was gonna go way into more depth and it was gonna be super super super entertaining for you guys and the finale was gonna be mind-blowing it woulda blew everyone's mind but the fact that spelled out of control I was forced to upload you know two times in one day and rush videos and get it done as quick as possible because I didn't want people to take actions into their own own hands and I'm super super proud that you guys look up to me and that means the absolute world to me my fans mean more to me than anything in my entire life and I say that staring right into your guy's eyes and I mean it from the bottom of my heart you guys mean the absolute world to me if I didn't have all the fans that I have I would be nothing and I would have nowhere to put my creative mind to you guys are my audience and I love you for that and you took it the wrong way and I'm sorry for that and I just had a rush a series so if you guys thought this was entertaining at all you have no idea what is going to come and maybe I have to like you know for the people that are watching this still maybe I have to like take it like a code word to say in a video for you guys to understand like don't be alarmed maybe I got to say like shish kebab or something like that in a video I don't know well think it's something but those are for my fans but you know for the outside people that come in you'll have no idea what I'm talking about and you'll be just as mind blown as all the other new people that are coming in so I mean there's youtubers already already doing boring vlogs if you want to see boring vlog just go to you know Casey nice that tanner Fox I'm gonna just vlog them their day and I'm not hating once again that's your style I love it it's a work run you're doing it if you want to see Pitt stuff guava juice is already doing baby kid stuff and other people are doing babies kid stuff there is no other youtuber doing it the way I'm doing it and I just want to make that clear that all this kind of just went spelled out of control I did not fake my death and the people that are in the comments saying fake thank thank thank it is literally like gnats it is so annoying sing fake fake fake fake fake it is not fake you guys remind me of like a person that will walk into a movie theater sit down and watch transformers and stand up in the middle of the movie and say there's no way this can happen this is fake and start young to all the audience that's watching the movie and the rest of the audience like [ __ ] you shut the [ __ ] up and try to watch the movie it's a movie you know and you kind of just look stupid by saying thank but I understand that you know if you're not open-minded and you didn't even get through this part of the video then I promise it's gonna go down there a comment that but people that are watching this and are open-minded enough to watch do it and listen to me before you made your assumptions and opinions then thank you so much I'm glad you understand now and I know there's probably so much more I have to say like so much more I have to say once again so the millions of time I I filmed this video and I'll end the video and then I would walk away like damn I didn't say everything I needed to say because there's so much I need to get off my chest obviously I'm gonna be vlogging I'm gonna be myself still I know a lot of people are concerned like hey Jake I know you're making this insane content that you can't find anywhere else on the Internet but are you still gonna be funny and be yourself of course obviously most of my vlogs are me and my friends messing around doing reckless things that is still gonna be an everyday thing but if something were to happen disremember guys I'm an entertainer and I'm doing my job because you guys know obviously I make money doing this obviously that's not you know hidden but I take my job seriously I am an entertainer and to me walking around vlogging it's just not entertaining that's not my style and I want to be able to put myself far away from those people that are taking YouTube as a joke where they'll vlog them tying a shoe and then go into a warehouse of merch or something that's just not my style my job is to make you guys glued to the screen be entertained and blow your [ __ ] mind and I know for a fact that my mind can blow your mind if you thought this was somewhat entertaining it broke the internet kind of sort of the way it did you guys don't even understand what was about to happen if I didn't have to end this series you guys wouldn't even be able to wrap your head around it and once again even though I am kind of the creative one behind all this I could not do this without any of my friends all my friends that helped me are like thank you so much like you know Joe's driving around me everywhere helping me staying out so 3 a.m. to help me film a video then the people like Chris my friend Chris Kyle he's helped me with all these supplies he's got all the stuff for me and he's being like behind the scenes of like the guy who got killed because that was him that got thrown in the lake and there's so much more behind it then you guys understand the editing process the thought process filming it getting in the clips done and making it seem as it's all one clip it's just so much and I hope that you guys can appreciate the amount of work that I'm putting into it rather than you being close-minded and ignorant being like but there's so much work so thank you to all my friends my friends are even though I have the creative mind I couldn't do it without them I couldn't do it by myself so maybe it's everything I have to say oh also you guys cared so much about me that there was four state police officers at my door saying they got hundreds of phone calls so I love you guys for that and that's on video too about police officers so yeah maybe I'll upload that to come or something like that and glad I inspire you guys there will be maybe I'll make merch okay here's the deal I will make a t-shirt right now it'll be first link in the description Dufner brand calm go to the first link in the description it will be a t-shirt that says create on it create because I want inspire guys to create and use a creative minds because every single person that's watching this right now has a creative mind but they're too scared to embrace it and they're too scared to let it let it wander and go where at launch so I'm gonna make a shirt that says create on it and we're just gonna do every single piece of profit that goes to that is not gonna go into my pockets it's gonna go into me creating crazier videos that will blow your guy's mind and me being able to you know put more money into my videos to create for you guys either that or the second option is I will donate it to a charity that is your guys choice so every single one that buys the merch SS creates on it right now in the first link in the description will either go towards a nonprofit organization charity or it will go into my videos being way more creative than I already am okay I love you guys to death if you watched the end of the video comment create down down below I love you guys to death there's probably more I have to say but does not I can't take it right now so you guys we'll hear from you soon make sure to hit that subscribe button and be ready for a [ __ ] journey because no one else is doing it the way I am deuces not for the people still watching it's time for you to be creative what if I did go missing by the killer he kidnapped me took my clothes and

24,Alfie Deyes Vlogs,Youtube,"Jun 18, 2018",Lets talk about the £1 video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLLwNBG1ang&list=PLsuhXm2zs07IwijVL8Mkm4EnPab78F7TC&index=15,film in the video if you've watched the third six-minute video which I've now decided to take down and I wanted to take down earlier on than what I did but I didn't want to take it down without having this video go up because I didn't want people to think that I'm trying to just like hide it away you kind of think like I fully I'm here taking the hip saying of course I messed up really really bad and I wanted this video to go at the same time that I take the video down because I don't want anybody to try and think that I'm avoiding this situation this is a very very big deal and I've made a massive a massive mistake here when I made the video I genuinely as you can see if watching it I didn't think about charity like I don't know how looking back on it I have no idea how I didn't think about it but I just simply saw this as and this is RIT where people have been calling me even and stuff and I'm not I fully get that like I 100 yeah I get how that came across like that like at one point in the video I'm holding one pound up and I'm saying that this is only going to spend today that's [ __ ] ridiculous when I was filming here I simply saw it as like another YouTube challenge like today I'm gonna try and live spending only one pound of course looking back now that is not that's not a challenge that is not something that should be on YouTube of course this doesn't amend anything that I've said or done in the video but I 100% just like every other video that I mentioned charity in I always donate the earnest to charity so 100 percent of the profits from that video will be donated charity I've already been on the phone to a charity in Brighton this morning seeing how I can help them out with donating the revenue from that video so I want to understand do you not want to earn obviously any money from that video but that's not me trying to make some big charitable donation to try and hide the fact and like that I messed up like no that's not what's happening here one thing that I've seen quite a lot online that I think is really unfair is people closing that video of my as like youtube and youtubers I've seen a lot of tweets from people being like see this is why YouTube has grabbed a blind youtubers this and I just want to put it out there and say no you cannot grope the entire YouTube community and all of the amazing stuff that that has done and that has bought into people's lives and start throwing when there's like a [ __ ] stupid video like the one that I've loaded a couple of days ago you cannot start saying this is why YouTube is bad YouTube in the community like the community there of youtubers out there yeah that community is so accepting and loving and like there are so many people doing amazing stuff like unbelievable stuff on YouTube so I just want to reiterate that when somebody does something stupid online and does like really does something super insensitive like the video I uploaded please do not categorize that as this is what youtubers do like no that's not know I also want to thank everybody like truly thank you to those who constructively told me that my video is wrong wherever that was tweeting me emailing me I want to thank you guys because it's people like you that helped shaping social media like there is so much [ __ ] out there online so much bad stuff and it's people who constructively guide people that are messing up and I've done stupid [ __ ] and take them to take their time like I appreciate your time educating me why my video is wrong that might be a bit of a weird one to say but I'm genuinely thankful for everybody in there's been a lot of people that have spent a lot of time writing messages and their notes about how their friends or family or themselves have had incredibly hard times with money and how insensitive my video was in relation to them and their lives and not really really not open my eyes till I holy [ __ ] yeah my video my video is not be on YouTube I've been making YouTube videos now for I mean next month it's going to be 10 years I've made over 2000 videos on this site and I should just know better like there's no excuse I should just know better than making content like this and I just wanna apologize to everybody that the video has affected because like I said I was just stupid like I did not it doesn't I'm not excusing anything I'm taking full hit my fault incredibly stupid incredibly just didn't think about it which is such a shame to think that I uploaded a video to a YouTube channel of mine and I tweeted there and I instagrammed about their - I don't know 10 million people with a piece of content that I didn't properly think about before I upload it like I only thought about it as like this sounds like a fun video and I did so many stupid things in that video and I said so many things that at the time like for example at one point I said oh in the eye I can't wear my workout it has like a big water machine and I can't use that water and I'm gonna have to have tap water instead and people have taken that as I now don't drink tap water which I sure do but I I understand how [ __ ] stupid I looked in that video or when I was talking about not being up to my morning coffee for me at the time I just saw that as I'm opening my eyes up to where I'm spending money and where me as our fee days in the future I should be being cautious of worms spending my money for example of coffee every morning for example every month where I work out I have like a three pound 50 big thing of water delivered and how I should appreciate those things more in my life but it for sure did not come across like that and I can see that now and came across completely differently and I apologize like genuinely very very sorry and I've just made myself look like a complete well I'm not looking for I'm not looking for any comments below that are I hope you I forgive you like I'm not looking for any that I just want a voice how I'm feeling right now I owe you guys better content I owe myself better content as I said the video has now been deleted and taken off of youtube all of the earnings from that video I'm in the process of shorting out funding I'm the best place to donate that money whether that's a homeless shelter whether that's a charity that helps people who are living below the poverty line wherever that may be I'm finding the best charity for that money and I'm gonna be donating that because I do not want to be earning any money off of that video I've also decided obviously as you can see to the Adsense off of this video because I don't want to be earning any money from this video something that I saw floating around on Twitter yesterday was the amount of people that were calling me a Tory and I just wanted 100% clear up right now that I'm not a Tory this sadness even sounds like stupid for me saying this coming out of my own mouth but the amount of tweets yesterday for people calling me a Tory I feel like I just need to say in this video right now that is for sure not the case I just want to apologize again to everybody who you guys better for sure and I hope you have a lovely day whatever you do,On,Original

27,Gabriel Zamora,YouTube,"Aug 22, 2018",My Truth,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWnmPEHzRrk,hi everyone I'm Gabriel Zamora and thank you for watching this video is definitely something I didn't think I was gonna upload if I'm being quite honest it's something that I feel like I need to upload now because there's certain apologies that I have to give especially on video and there are certain things I want to further explain I have now filmed this this is my third time filming this the reason why is because the first two times I feel like hey I was able to vent I was able to really just let all my emotions and say how I felt like and just lay it all out on the line and they were really long videos and I'm like you know why this isn't about just my emotions it's about me just talking about what happened and clarifying certain things and asked to why certain things were done and kind of more of a back story behind it the first apology that I owe that I definitely wanted to make sure was in this video at the very beginning is to y'all my audience because I was the person that I didn't want to be and it was being negative being Petty and bringing negativity into a world that didn't need it and for that I'm truly sorry and I've know I've let y'all down because I let myself down that's not who I should be I started doing YouTube because I wanted to spread happiness and love and positivity and acceptance and just laughter like I wanted people to have fun because that's how I looked at YouTube I looked at it is like this is so much fun it's a great escape it kind of takes me away from any stress that I have or if I'm just like bored and I just want something to entertain me like that's what I loved about YouTube so the fact that I wasn't that I'm truly sorry because that's not what I should be doing and for that I will take full accountability and I'm sorry and moving forward I don't want to be like that and I will work my hardest to not be like that the second apology that I owe is for an old tweet of mine that resurfaced from 2012 I don't want to give you excuses as to what my train of thought was just know that it was ignorant and it was stupid and it didn't come from hate I know a lot of people on the internet have said that I am a racist and based on that tweet I asked that before you say those words you now take time to realize what that means because I have taken time to realize that just putting out ignorant isn't gonna help a situation because I've done that so for that I'm truly sorry and I've learned from it and I hope that my actions since then have shown y'all that I've learned from it and I've better educated myself I want to link to videos down below just to further help the situation if one is still not fully cleared on it one is just the backstory on how that word has come about and how it's developed over time and a second video that I really respect is an author explaining why that word isn't for other people and I've respected it since but I feel like this video is very straight to that point and it's clear and it's concise and I totally agree with what's being said in that video I'll link that down below and just know that I understand that it's not my word and I've understood it ever since I I was educated back then and I know it's not my word and I'm truly sorry that people still use that word and think that it doesn't have certain negative connotations and I'm sorry that I fed into that at one point in my life I was ignorant and I was stupid and I take full accountability and just know that I'm sorry I'm still sorry and I will keep saying I'm sorry for that I'm truly I'm sorry in the third apology that I do oh on camera is to Jeffrey I'm sorry just for everything not just for the tweets not just for the photo just for it all just for allowing myself to create an image of someone based on what others were telling me and it's not fair because I wouldn't want that for me so I want to go on camera and say that I'm truly sorry to you Jeffrey because what I did wasn't intended to be bullying but I know now that it came across like that and I totally respect that and I'm sorry for that I want to talk about the tweet now and I have certain things that I've written down that I want to clarify oh and I don't want to edit this video so I just wrote everything down in my notes of things I don't want to hit on so let's explain well let me explain the photo the tweet so the photo context was just that a recreation of Kylie's birthday photo it wasn't taken in a sense to bash on you want to try to disrespect Jeffrey it wasn't taken like that it was just taken to be dumb and funny I then took it upon myself the next day to tweet the photo with that text nobody else saw this before I tweeted it I just tweeted it so when I tweeted it just if you care to know just a little backstory on it was I was hungover I rarely drink so I said I'm gonna drink this day and I woke up hungover as how headache there's no excuse I'm just saying this is the mental space that I was then so I was irritable I was like just cranky and then I'm seeing certain things online about Jeffrey doing this to my friends and I'm like okay they I just keep hearing about this person and I keep hearing this and I keep hearing that and I'm like why is someone who's so successful being so petty that was my train of thought in that moment and I'm like you know what let me be shady on the Internet I will I'm one of the people that will if I'm shady I will own it because just don't be Shady and be like oh no it was an accident no like if you're being Shady own it and I was being shady I was being petty in that tweet and I tweeted it nobody else knew so I have I just want to go on timeline when did everybody else find out everybody else found out well I started to get likes and I started to get a retweet or like a response and then Nikita calls me and she's like what was that tweet like are you okay like what's wrong like what's what's going on and I'm like you know what I'm tired of this pettiness I'm tired of this and I explained it and she's like okay just so you know it's very clear as to who you're trying to be Petty towards and be like in that sense and I'm like okay she's like okay just so you know and I'm like okay so when we leave the hotel we get into a bus to go to a pool party and ten minutes into the bus ride it's brought up so what happened on Twitter and I'm like you know what I'm just tired of this person constantly doing this to y'all because I keep hearing he does this he he does that he does this he is that he's such a malicious person he so mean he's this I keep hearing these things and I'm like I'm like I'm fed up I'm fed up I keep absorbing all this negative all this negativity and I'm finally fed up like I'm over it but this is also someone who's never done anything to me never done anything petty to me so I just finally had it and it's like okay well just so you know it looks like you know people are starting to like speculate as to who it is it's pretty clear like it's really clear and I'm like okay like and I made even more tweets tweets that I definitely fluffed up because I was like you know what I want to create a narrative and it's not fair and I now realize how that affects people because a certain narrative was painted about me in this whole process and I'm like you know what that wasn't fair and one shouldn't be doing that try to make someone seem some type of way to try to get people on either your site or try to see something some certain type of way one should never try to tell people what to think or what to see or anything people should be able to do that themselves so that's when they're like okay well like certain hate starting to pop up we get to the pool party and other during that bus right other things were being talked about other negativity and we get on the we get to the pool party and we I'm still seeing tweets I'm still seeing more and more and more things come up and it's like becoming a lot like even for me like I know I know I started it so I'm gonna take I'm gonna take full responsibility for it but I'm it's like it's a lot so during that process Nikita comes up and she's like hey like just so you know like it looks like we all did this like it looks like all four of us were in on this and it looks like it's like we're bullying him and I'm like oh crap and they're starting to get a bunch of hate because of my tweet and I'm like oh crap like this isn't fair for me to pull someone into this and I fully took responsibility and I apologized to my friends I'm like hey I'm really sorry because I dragged you into this mess and I'm bringing you into this mess and it was like oh no it's fine it's fine we will get through this wearing it together it's fine I apologize to Laura I apologize to Manny and I'm like I'm sorry and it was very much the narrative of it's just really bad timing so it wasn't it's not fair that you try to make it seem like we hate him it was it's just really bad timing because of this docu-series and everybody's on his side and in my head I'm like well if you feel some type of way about someone irregardless of what it is is it regardless of what it is regardless of when it is you should still feel that kind of way but I'm like okay you know what it's true I'm gonna just listen and take that and allow people to speak if they're saying that and this is how they feel that's fine I then go to Laura and I'm like hey I'm really sorry I don't know what to do in this situation I want to somehow start making this better what do you think I should do and she's like do you mind deleting that photo because even I agreed there was just a lot of accusations about her family a lot of just false accusations about her family and then I started to people start saying certain things about certain people and it was like is this true wait is this true I was seeing those responses and I'm like okay I totally agree I'll delete it she's like are you sure and I was like yeah I'll delete it I'm taking full ownership this is my fault I know what I started and I want to make this better that's why I deleted that tweet because Laura asked me after I offer it how do I fix this let that be clear so then let's see everything was alright after that and why I took it down okay cool then we went to another pool and that's what we started to hang out that's when my old tweet came up and I voiced it to my friends it's like oh crap like there's now Oh an old tweet of mine coming up and I'm being painted out to be as racist and I'm like I want to explain this because I've learned from this and I want to apologize to anyone who's being affected and I want to be able to explain this just a little bit further so they were aware I created my own apology I wrote it down I wanted to make sure that it was concise and I tweeted it it was it was my truth it was me apologizing for me owning up to it I know what I did it came from my social account I changed it on Instagram because I was a this is inappropriate but it had tweeted it out as well so I'm like okay just know that when you put something out on the internet it's remains on the Internet the reason a lot of people were like you're so stupid why didn't you delete this just so you know I've deleted that tweet twice not out of like oh my god like I don't want to ever get caught no because I learned from it and I was like oh wow like this shouldn't be on there even before I started social media I looked at all my tweets hours I could anything be taken as inappropriate because I'm not malicious never gone out of my way to try to bash someone in a racial way or in just in like a petty way in that sense so I'm like this tweet will haunt me I know it will because I've tried deleting it and it won't go away and that's fine I'll fully owned up to it I've done so everyone was like you'll get it's fine we'll get through this rain then that night I go to my hotel I decide not to go out I'm like this is just too much I'd rather just go to sleep we're leaving the next day our car comes for us to take us to the airport at like 6 or 7 a.m. and I'm like you know why I should just pack just take a shower decompress and I was looking at comments and I was starting to like delete stuff and blocks of cuz I'm like this is this is becoming a lot like it's a lot so then the next day we're leaving and we're traveling back 40 minutes okay I'm trying to like keep this short so then we come back we start going to the airport I get onto the bus I'm still not aware what's really going on with everybody else but Nikita's like are you okay I was again I'm fine and she's like okay well like there's like just so you know they're starting to bring up like tweets on everybody like they're bringing ever like old things of everyone up and I'm like like that's I didn't want all this to happen but when you put out negativity out into the world just understand that it will give it back to you what the energy that you put out is what you receive so I'm now trying to focus on putting positivity out and I'm learning from that because I've always been like that so I don't I regret that I allowed myself to become negative and I'm like okay so we have a layover in Amsterdam and then it's two hours and I'm like filtering comments and I'm like this is too much like this is a law like it's it's now exploding and this is before it all and I'm like it's becoming a lot and I'm like it was it was taking a real toll on me and if I'm being honest I was trying to just become numb because it was it was a lot like I didn't want to think I didn't want to feel anything and I've had moments of just sadness and that just kind of like took me back and I know that I started this I'm taking full accountability but in that moment and that's just how I felt I wasn't really talking I wasn't trying to interact with anyone I'm just like this is just it's a lot like it's a lot so we then get on our flight back to the u.s. back to LA and I just decided to go to sleep and I might just try to try to sleep this off or like try to like decompress it go to sleep just go to sleep and I slept for the majority of the fly and I wake up probably two hours before we land and 15 minutes into it my friends come up to me and the conversation is led and I'm gonna be honest the conversation is led by Manny Laura chimes in every once in a while and Nikita didn't say anything and I was just watching it all I'm assessing everything I'm like okay like what's what's going on the conversation has had of hey just so you know it's becoming a lot more and I'm like okay and we've been talking to our managers and our PR team and we've just been thinking of a PR way to handle this and I'm like okay and they have recommended that you take full accountability for the photo you apologize for the photo and you apologize to us for us not being involved and I'm like okay okay cool I tweeted it let's not blue line stop so sorry about so I don't like that it seemed that I was the only one who thought this I don't like that it was like oh Gabriel you're gonna take full accountability cool I did tweet it but let's not try to make it seem like other people didn't really think these things so I'm like okay cool but I will take full accountability I take that I if I uh I will take full accountability so it is then you're gonna have to apologize first this is all man Laura's like chiming in but one of the parts that kind of annoyed me was I wasn't given the respect of being looked at in the eyes while this is being had while I'm being told what to do so I'm like I'm starting to see these things I'm like okay read people's body language I'm staring at him and I'm not oh it's just a little blah I'm like okay cool you're gonna have to take full accountability your apology's gonna have to go out first so I would start working on it and based off of your apology this person goes next this person goes next and I will be last and we all get we'll all gage kind of like what the other one needs to fix okay if you're sorry you're sorry just put it out there I don't I don't I don't understand why it has to be like this this this this and this no like why are we why are we setting up others apology for success if you're you're sorry just apologize and be sorry so I'm like okay cool it sucks because I I felt like it was like okay like cool like I'll take full accountability and I guess I'll be the person who hates him online and I'm the only one who thinks this that's fine I know I and these are my friends you need to do right by them so when I start heading home from the airport I get nauseous in the backseat on my phone for too long I'm already nervous I'm anxious it's a lot I don't even want to look at my phone I want to look straight forward and I just want to not throw up in this situation and I get a text message of from Annie hey how are you doing are you okay I just see it and I'm like I can't even respond like it's just it's a lot so I'm like sitting there it's like a 45 minute drive almost by the end of it I get a tech message of hey I really hey we really need you to put out this apology because it's a storm for everybody else Gabby and I'm like wait didn't you just text me wondering how I am you don't hear from me and then it's hey we need cool okay interesting I'm not texting you back because your headspace wasn't to see if I was good it was to see what am I putting this out cool so I come home and I write my own apology I wrote my own apology just so y'all know I wrote it yeah there was a revision so I wouldn't mess up but the only thing that was at it was me attacking somebody else that didn't deserve it who was part of the Ipsy community that person definitely didn't need from me to attack them the way that I did I was angry and she just stated an opinion it was a little bit sassy but it was her truth and I respect it but in that moment I attacked I didn't care I just attacked and she did deserve an apology and I was like you know what that's true all the other apologies apologizing to NARS apologizing to epsy apologizing to my friends apologizing to my community to the beauty community was me writing that out so Laura put out her apology first because she didn't want to wait she wanted to apologize and I respected that then I even had called her and I was like hey like I don't know like should I be doing a video should I be putting text out I don't know what to do and it's like an apology is an apology you don't don't feel like you have to do something so that people can understand it an apology is an apology as long as you are apologizing and you're sincere about it it's an apology and I'm like okay and I cried and I was like I think duh like I I did I caused this for you as well I caused this for me and she and we cried and I put on my apology and I went to sleep that is everything with that with the photo in my apology what happened next was where I got upset that I was being painted in a different type of way so first Manny's apology wasn't an apology because there wasn't any and I'm sorry in there his initial quote tweet of mine I wake up that Tuesday and I I get a notification that he had quote tweeted me and I'm like wait what okay let me go do it thank you for owning up to it and all these things I'm like excuse me so I screenshot it because I'm like wait am I crazy Thank You Gabi for speaking up we took that photo with the intent of recreating Kylie's 21st birthday picture with her sisters true the reason I liked it was because it was a photo of the four of us being silly the night before I didn't read the caption as I had been running around he was in his hotel just so you know when he was liking and responded to him maybe he was running around his hotel room that might be the case but you can't tell me that you didn't see it you didn't read that tweet it was a short sentence and it starts with the curse word and it's the photo of us four you're just gonna like something and respond to it no no no no no that's no that's not what we're gonna do and then once I was notified about the caption from you all I removed my like and asked Gabi to take it down as the photo was supposed to be a fun recreation again nothing more I wasn't asked by him to take it down when I said earlier I asked Laura how would you like me to better these things that's why I took it down let that be clear I would so that's why I'm like why are you now creating this narrative the same thing you do in every situation if we're keeping it a hundred let's keep it a hundred you know you feel these things let's keep it a hundred you feel these things somebody else does too okay other people do too so don't act like oh no like this no no no no you feel that so let's not paint it out to be like I'm the one cool no no no okay Coco I'm getting emotional right so when I read that on my messy can never help themselves when you're messy you remain messy so not only are you being messy and your quote sweet let me go look at what you've been liking and what you've been responding to so why am I seeing of course you didn't read the caption it was all fun and games until it backfired on the four of you it absolutely was not at all it was childish and I'm too grown for that honestly you're too grown too grown for what you constantly talk about him you constantly say all these things you constantly use people let's look at track records let's look at track records I don't have bad blood with anybody maybe there's one person that I and me and her have an understanding of we don't with each other but let's keep it respectful that's it she's not in this community so why are you the one who constantly keeps burning bridges and using people but you're too grown no you can't you say worse let's keep it a hundred you've said works so my tweet that kind of set it all off was no no no Manny stayed up out of it and I and think about who your friends are he drug you down did a half-assed apology and no one is buying trust me it's been an eye-opening 24 hours as his response I looked at other tweets he was liking I wouldn't say friends with someone that put me in a bad position and created all this drama why are you liking this yeah I may have started this but let's not act like you don't feel like this if not worse because I've heard you say worse okay the 26 minutes my camera shuts off at 30 minutes I'll have to double checking so I'm like interesting let me go look at if anybody else is being shady right now I go look at Nikita no because real friends don't throw other friends under the bus even by throwing that kind of underlying shade there's multiple tweets that he liked so I was a cool so then Laura's responding to people me man didn't have any part in the tweak ever posted we asked him him take it down and he did what do you mean we I asked you how do I better this and you said can you take that tweet down and I said yes let's not ask like I was told to do anything let's not act like that then she says I did not ever like a comment the photo Manny did without reading the caption and within a few seconds he removed his comment like okay so you're defending someone and let's keep that clear she did defend him and was she didn't have to say Manny did but he took it down just so you're aware since your apologies go now where is he on this because that's your best friend okay cool so I'm looking at all these tweets and I'm like oh really like okay we're gonna play this narrative cool if y'all are out for yourself and you're thinking how do I better this for myself let me say face for myself and you're probably thinking well gamer you're probably reading into it maybe they didn't see those tweets or maybe they didn't fully read or maybe they're like just kind of like it's too much for them just so you know I know these people a lot better than a lot of you do let's let's keep it a hundred in the sense of I see how they move maybe I don't know what they did on their fourth birthday maybe I don't know everything about their family maybe I don't know know certain things but when I see them move I am aware of what kind of person they are and to hear them constantly complain oh well this person like this tweet and it was shady about me constantly they've been aware for years that liking something shady is obvious that responding something shady is obvious they're creating that narrative and it's obvious these are my friends I saw them I see how they move so it's not me just misinterpreting things over reading things no because there was a lot of people online saying wait what just throw him under the bus like wait didn't y'all also have a falling-out with him why is Gabriel the sacrificial lamb all these people are saying it how am i okay I'm not crazy I am I am feeling these things with some reason but I said 20 minutes let me okay let me know so then I had to think you have to now not in a sense worry about yourself but realize what it is you want to do what feels right for you no longer okay let me not like certain things let me not do certain things let me remain hush-hush so it doesn't add to the fire let me not add fuel to the fire so now I'm like you know what I wanted to apologize to Geoffrey that is an apology I wanted to create to give and I literally take it once I realize these things I'm like you know what you should be apologizing to him even if you've been kind of made out to feel like you shouldn't or that isn't your friend or this isn't a good person you should apologize to this person because you did attack them online you should apologize to them personally first so I wrote out a text an apology it was a long one and he went through and I got a response back my number wasn't blocked so there was a conversation had we we spoke on the phone and I apologized for everything just allowing myself to create an image of someone in my head in a negative light based on what I was being fed because it wasn't fair for me to do that to anyone to hear all these things about someone and never have experience in myself but still think these things about that person I'm like I'm sorry for that I'm just sorry for a lot of things a lot of clarity came from that conversation a lot of things made a lot more sense once you heard once I heard the other side of the story I thought my friends are gonna tell me the truth that's not always the case so when he explains situation that I thought why is he being irrationally angry it made sense why he was mad a message and this situation it made a lot more sense than I'm like am I may being lied to why okay cool cool cool so I then tell him I'm like I would I personally would love to apologize online publicly to you I'm not gonna say I spoke to you I'm not gonna say anything I'm not gonna tell anyone I would just like to do that do you mind if I do that and he's like no I totally respect it thank you for that so when I created my apology I took me 24 hours I wanted to sleep on him I still wanted to apologize to him publicly but I wanted it all to kind of process it what do you want to do next Gabriel when I woke up I was like you know why there's a certain individual day do you need to cut out of my life because it's always just been toxic a lot of the negativity around you and around your friends has been due to this one person there's the same factor in all these negative situations around your life because I've had a lot of friends and there's always these negative things going on and that seems to be the remaining factor and that's Manny so I'm like you know what you're not that cool with this person if I'm keeping it a hundred which ah it wasn't that friendship was this weird narrative of after he's had all these falling outs and so has she Laura we're just we don't really have friends let's just all constantly hang out and I'm thinking oh my god my friends want to constantly hang out like this so cool like they're some of the top people in the beauty industry and it's fun to just hear inside perspective from somebody else and these are also people who understand it I'm growing and I'm new to this so it's cool to just hear like inside tips and tricks like Laura has helped me so much with my youtube channel and my social media in general just given me advice giving me tips giving me she's like my home is yours or whatever you want to do you want to film sit like what do you like anything so that's her and Nikita have been the only ones that have really helped me I'm not saying Manny didn't but he gave me a link to where I could get Final Cut Pro like text and South cool there's been always like a hey you should be posting more and I'm okay okay okay okay like I do want to post more but I always been yeah I'm not consistent when it comes to posting but I'd rather post something that I love as opposed to me thinking I have to post and I feel like that's where I was going crazy me personally I'm not saying it was because of anybody else because I was like I'm going crazy I feel like I have to post like two to three times a week on YouTube and like every single day on Instagram and this and that I have to post up this but particular time because these this is what I'm hearing constantly no I don't and that's why I was going crazy that's the only thing he's really helped me with so that narrative of we're all close kind of start to mess with me because I'm like I don't know anything about him really and he doesn't know anything about me but he's constantly hanging out with other people and having these close moments but I don't I don't get a hang out I don't get a phone call I don't get nothing so I'm like okay cool this is a person you need to cut out of your life you've been wanting to cut them out ever since he threw Laura under the bus when Laura and Jeffery had that falling-out he'd threw her under the bus let's keep it 100 why is it that two people who were in the wrong with him only one gets out alive behind the scenes if I'm keeping it 100 I was done with him I was like are you serious I see my friend and she is hurt she is distraught I'm getting emotional I wanted to cut him off it hurt because I felt like in that situation I was backing up a friend that I felt was hurt and then that friend then turns around and his buddy buddy and then I get pushed aside and I'm like wait I thought you were her and that's why I was hurt as well and then I was hurt that I was being kind of like pushed aside and I'm like okay cool you can't be mad at someone's situation and they're not mad themselves and that took time during that situation for me to process but I'm like okay cool we try to better that's a tuition it was talked over between me and Laura but during that time I did get an apology from Manny I'm so sorry that it just looks like this and I've hurt you and I've hurt my cool if you didn't throw her under the bus why are you apologizing interesting so when I wake up that day and I tweet out I'm sorry Jeffrey star I go to his tweet I copy and I paste what I also relate to it has been an eye-opening 24 hours because when he tweeted that the 24 hours that he was referring to was the flight and certain people's situations being come up like his insensitive snapchat so okay cool for me I saw myself get thrown under my narrative is being painted out us differently I have apologized to someone that I needed to and they have cleared up so much more for me so the next day I'm like it has been an eye-opening 24 hours I wanted that shade you know why because as an audience y'all see it you see the shade I knew I've always been told you can manipulate the audience to think what you want them to oh my god this video is so long you can paint it out to be some type of way cool I want it to be done I tweeted out he's trying to contact me I'm not responding I'm like I'm out it felt good it sounds dark but I felt good to just cut someone off like that I thought that cutting off a friend would be bad but it felt good and I didn't understand why but further realizing and it's like that was a toxic person in your life you shouldn't have been friends with this person you shouldn't have been hanging out with this person to be quite honest because you not really each other like that okay if I'm keeping it 100 we didn't so I'm like okay cool so then I am follow him of course he freaks out because people are not catching on to it and he then sends me a voice memo that he's outside my building and it's like hey I said your building you can't come into my building unless I allow you and you're on a list so of course he's not being let in so I get a voice memo here I'm outside your building I don't know why I'm here I just wanted to talk to you face to face I know you must be going through a lot we're all going through a lot what do you mean we're all going through a lot what are we all going through because it looked like I was I was only one going yeah certain people were going through things as well but I didn't tweet other people's things my photo I have now taken full accountability for that tweet I've taking full accountability for I have apologized to y'all publicly what do you mean we at this point because y'all are liking shady things it's no longer we and then he apologizes for liking and responding to things that he misinterpreted I'm tired of this I misinterpreted this oh I'm so sorry because of this oh I'm so sorry but it's because of this no if you're sorry you're sorry just keep it a hundred keep it a hundred with me and I will respect you yeah even if you were like hey I did like some shady tweets about you I'm kind of upset with you because you started that you shouldn't have but even though we all feel like this I was upset and I like these tweets and I shouldn't have I'm sorry for that I would have respected that because you know I'm like you know what yaki che to me buddy is keeping it a hundred no don't say you didn't reach don't say these things when I know how you move I know how you work no we're not gonna do that so I don't respond I'm just since then I have I tweeted that and I gave the respect of not doing anything more not liking anything more not tweeting anything not doing anything right so just seeing it all play out now that I feel like okay I've apologized I'm backing up because what I did wrong everything I've apologized for it right I'm contemplating a video apologizing to my audience and just that just apologizing maybe like still taking blame for that photo and not really going into JEP like I'm going in now but to see someone go online and apologize to someone rightfully deserve he did deserve to apologize to that little girl but you're not gonna talk about anything else you're not gonna apologize to someone that has helped you get to where you are even though you've played the he offered it he didn't do things for me he didn't have to offer these things this is someone who's already so successful and you're freaking I'm good you're like I don't know where to go and I don't know what manufacture to use a bubble of this bubble that and your friend is like well I mean I can put in a good word for you in my place and I can give you these contacts don't act like this person and do nothing for you okay because even though I during that time wasn't the biggest fan of Jeffry I always respected advice that he had given me one of the biggest advice was don't waste all your money that's gonna be one of the biggest mistakes that you do coming into it I can give you any advice I did that and I blew two my money and I wasn't saving anything and it's true I was in the beginning starting to blow money I was like oh wow okay that's true I should be saving money so I always respected that and I respected certain things and certain critiques and certain advice he would give me and I would say that would be like he's a smart businessman maybe I'm not the biggest fan of him but he's a smart businessman I would say that but don't go online and not apologize to the person who has helped you the most the most because a lot of people have helped you and I will always say who's helped me I'm not gonna say right here but you can go to my previous videos you can go to interviews that I've done and I give credit where credit is due I'm not here today off of my own blood sweat and tears so many people have helped me get to where I am and I give credit so don't go online in that give that boot type of video because yeah that girl deserved to be apologized to but then you're gonna apologize for an insensitive snapchat that was brought up during this and you're gonna mention his name in the video and not apologize to him cool but when Laura's apology came out and she was dragged through the dirt drug through the mud because you got a lot of hate for not responding to that and she made sure to include it in hers you weren't anywhere to defend your friend but there's a tweet of her defending you at one point there's your best friends trust me that when someone with my friends as you all have seen I go up to bat but when I saw nobody was going up to bat for me publicly even though I had one friend in that group helped me behind the scenes be like hey you did this tweet and it's bullying but I'm here for you and I want to make sure that you're good I heard that one friend only one friend was aware that I have never dealt with this this is a lot for a person to deal with and that person's checking out on me cuz that's right or die so when you don't defend your friend online even though you probably did the worst to be quite honest because you sucked that friendship dry and then you try to get out for like get alpha save it but this person I remember got the biggest hit so when he attacked her and you got out safe whose house did you go to right after that to go apologize to let's keep it a hundred I'm tired of this narrative being put out that someone is so sweet and someone is so good when behind the scenes I know so much more and I'm going crazy because this image is being painted out and it's being well-received as your good no your friend was just drugged to the dirt I know for a fact that Laura isn't a malicious person does she do stupid things yes but I personally in my experience with Laura know that she's not a malicious person but I'm not gonna go up to defend her because I didn't get no defense you were liking shady things I'm not defending you at this point but your best friend isn't gonna defend you and it's gonna allow all this while you get the biggest hit and you're losing the most when in actuality you didn't do as much as he did cool it's been an eye-opening experience if I'm being quite honest is a long video and I'm sorry it's this long but it just it's my truth and it's a I know I'm venting a lot and I'm I want to just wrap it up at this point I don't want to convince young on anything don't let me tell you how to feel don't let me tell you what to see allow others to show you who they are look at it all look at it all and really realize who these people are because I try to keep it a hundred and I allowed myself to not I made myself seem like I was like best friends and like all this and I did hate this person as well no I'm sorry for that to myself and to y'all because it's a lot like it's a lot it's a lot it's a lot to just process and I hope that this video put some clarity as to me and my truth and my experience I know I've bent at all and I'm sorry for that it just it's it's just built up and don't forgive me because I'm asking you but just look at me moving forward and maybe you need a break from me and that's fine but if in a month and two and six in a year you come back and check on me I hope that my actions have proven that I've grown from this and I've learned from this and that's all I can ask for if you no longer want to be a fan of me or be part of my social family I completely understand that because I let myself down so I know I let a lot of people down because I saw those comments so I always thought you weren't gonna be petty or dramatic or problematic that's one of the reasons why I was being so nervous and scared about this video it's not because I was scared of anyone it was because I was scared of looking as problematic when I didn't want to be like that but all these things are going and it's all started from that one tweet and I want to now clarify a little more from my side because there's a lot of assumptions out there as to oh he probably did this or they were all in cahoots with that tweet or they said not no like I want to clear a lot of things up and I want to apologize to y'all because I was Petty and I was negative and I allowed myself to be there and I'm sorry for that it's a lot I'm still gonna take more time to just allow this to fully process and because I feel like I can't just click a switch in my head and be done with things sometimes a universe forces you to start a new chapter even if you think you're not ready you have to move forward with it and I have to move forward with this and I know that I picked up in the past and I want to learn from this and I want to take time to really reflect and just cleanse myself and I've been talking to just friends that I haven't talked to in a while been talking to family I've just been really just assessing the whole situation and seeing where I went wrong where I stopped and I'm sorry for that like I truly am that I'm not the best version of myself as I've recently I'm not and I want to take time to just realize that allow that to sink in and see how I can better myself moving forward for me and for y'all because I'm not going anywhere I'm not gonna just quit I love what I do and thank you to y'all for allowing me to do this it just feels good to say it it truly does to just put my truth out there I just I feel like weights just lifted okay I don't want to further discuss this I'm not gonna just save all my comments there's any other advice you can give me when it comes to better educating myself I would love to hear it you can write that down online I know I'll get a lot of hate still and that's fine because this apology isn't for it to be accepted and for me to be the good guy again and for me to be liked again it's for me to explain my side and hopefully certain people can see that this is my truth and this is me being honest oh my god it feels good thank you,On,Original
28,RiceGum,YouTube,"Jan 4, 2019",This Dude Calls Me Out For Mystery Unboxing...,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4E8qmF10Mts&t=5s,I'm telling you guys man I'm not playing around 2019 I have not playing around I posted yesterday I'm here again today I'm gonna see you guys the bottles but how is everybody doing whoever was doing fine yesterday I was doing really good man great vibes great energy and then today bad not so much I woke up to this man the front page of Twitter talked about Jay Paul and race come under fire for promoting gambling site to kids like I don't want to be associated with this guy and it just doesn't look good and there's no way to start the year like what do you need to clear this up because I don't even think it's a big deal so the other day I posted a video where I was promoting this website basically my management just kidding me I was like yo rice here's this deal about the half for whatever you get paid right and I'll YouTube it's like a common thing like when youtubers work with brands and sponsored videos like I've seen Shane Dawson just I've seen so many youtubers do it keeps their actually tweet his saying first big start of 2019 Jake par ice tub gambling blah blah blah but at the bottom he said I was offered a haunted cave to do the same thing and almost took the cash but didn't so I can't go that hard on them so apparently they only offered keep star 100k so my numbers are higher so imagine how much they offered me right so the money was on the table and if I wanted that money I just had to open up a few supreme boxes and shoe boxes and boom I get the mice all like yeah that sounds easy enough I dropped the video really think nothing much of it and I just don't know where all these random as youtubers I don't know where come out drop and exposed videos calling me and out for doing this doing that about the whole gambling thing is like even hdhd know guys I actually filmed this video survey at the time h3h3 was the most popping youtuber to call me out but the things have changed this morning peer advisors up the video I'm I'm in the title I'm in the thumb now this news the biggest youtuber in the world man I guess this is like a big deal this popular youtuber made a video like kind of roasting me I mean like mainly roasting Jake but like he said some things about me too but I just find it so funny like I think it's hilarious that like this you know daily thing is the current you know topic of discussion right now it's like a big deal but it's just like there's his youtube name reaction time he actually has more so I don't know how because he's not closer than me but anyways he'd be the same type of view the same time it feels like three months ago don't let said anything it wasn't a problem back then look look look all these guys right here right there diamond door it's true whatever they're influential got kid fans same thing opened up bosses this was three weeks ago way before I was doing it why didn't no one bring it up to three weeks still we even talked about these guys this guy board's same exact big literally same thing four months ago he's not even promoting gambling to kids he is a kid yeah let's do 17 gambling it's not a problem they're right don't even get me started as last night robber to start more subscribers than me wise gonna talk about this guy and he makes slime videos he make slime video do you know what that means no one over the age of 10 is watching slime videos I'm sorry manly I'd be cursin to my fails so I got some older kids younger kids this guy got all kid fans promoted the ass little months ago I'm gonna stay here and just bring up everyone that did the same deal as me I'm just trying to say this mystery box thing has been on the internet for like three to four months from other creators but as soon as I do it it's a problem actually some people compare what I did to the csgo gambling thing I'm just like what is not even close I don't know if you guys heard about that this year's dog everything there was these two youtubers team art and syndicate right or whatever and they were like promoting this gambling at and the Vale that were unboxing all these crazy things that cost a lot of money come to find out those two guys owned like the gambling site like there were owners of it which means they could easily just went into the back end just higher their chances of winning so they got exposed that was like a whole big thing because they're like scam in their face I don't know this is particularly breath I don't know what they have going on like people keep saying that the website is sketchy and all this stuff is like you guys can form your own opinions do your research of my experience on it you know I would spend $100 at times I got like a Finch's spinner and then I would spend $1 at half times I got like a good item it was basically you win some you lose some and that's like the tradition of gambling like thinking back was even worth doing this deal like all this controversy was he even worth it out oh man you know I do feel bad you know I'm I kind of faked myself and stuff but I do know I'm somewhat in the wrong I think just h3 said it better there's a reason you need to be 21 years old to gamble because you need to know what you're doing it's a dangerous it's addicting it's a very it's a vice right it's a it's a real advice many lives have been ruined due to gambling addiction quite literally gambling to an eight to twelve year old especially on you two we're just supposed to be a reputable sighs strode it's true I'm an [ __ ] like what was I thinking like I can't lead ooh much cuz I already did it the damage has been done guys already saw a money-hungry side up and it is what it is and there's nothing I can really do but say sorry and give you these Amazon gift cards so I'm sorry it just wouldn't happen again Amazon cuz ten to twenty dollars just a little giveaway it's the least I can do after what you know this you know okay have a good day guys I'm sorry again I hope you guys can forgive me let's have a good here ya know okay,On,Original

30,James Charles,YouTube,"May 19, 2019",No More Lies,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFvtCUzfyL4,one week ago I uploaded a video to my youtube channel titled Tati this video was a direct response to the video that Tati Westberg uploaded to her channel titled by a sister before I say anything at all in this video I want to make it very very clear that everything I said in that video in regards to it my sentiments towards Tati and my apology I stand behind 100% and still rain true I know I got emotional in the video I apologize it was something very very hard for him to deal with especially when it came to talking about my very own mother in talk to his video she discusses many of the different reasons as to why she was choosing to close a chapter in her life that I was heavily involved in making many of our private issues very very very public and now millions and millions of people have weighed in with their opinions and speculations on subjects that they honestly know absolutely nothing about I will not ask for sympathy and I will definitely not ask for forgiveness either but I will ask that you watch this entire thing all the way through before forming any further opinions or talking about this story more hello future James here popping in quickly I know doing an insert in a video like Future James this is not professional trust me but I filmed this several times now and as time keeps going on more and more things keep coming out into the public and more people are speaking on the situation and it is very important to me that this video has all the information all the facts all the receipts and is current and present because I will not be addressing it again after this matter this morning when I was editing this video I noticed that last night totsied uploaded a video to her channel called why I did it and this morning Geoffrey Starr was on snapchat talking about the whole situation first and foremost I do want to issue a thank you to both Jeffrey and Tati for taking some of the responsibility for blowing this whole thing up and for starting everything I really respect that a lot and I also appreciate the fact that they are trying to redirect the hate away because I think we're all aware at this point that it has gotten way too far the past week on the Internet has been at the darkest I think we've all ever seen and it's also been the darkest time that I've ever had to go through and my life and my thoughts gone to a really scary place watching takis video it's clear to me that she also is in a really dark place as well and has been pained by this whole situation if I've known anything about talk to you over the past three years it says she has a huge huge heart there's no tonight and I think that or I do believe her when she says that she did not want this to get so vile I don't really think any of us thought it's gonna be as big as it really was in both of their videos Jeffrey and Tati both mentioned that they hope that I'm able to change and then we can all move on from the situation and trust me I agree there's nobody that wants it's over with as much as I do but in takis second video and in Jeffrey snapshots they both said that they stand behind everything that they mentioned and unfortunately there have been allegations made against me because of these things and I don't really feel comfortable just moving on from those I would like to take this video today as an opportunity to kind of explain everything that has happened and address literally everything there's a lot that happened behind the scenes leading off to talk days video and there's a lot that happened behind the scenes and publicly after takis video and I feel so it is my responsibility to kind of let you guys in on those because there's a lot of misinformation going around and it's just not really good just like talking said in her video this whole situation is a lot bigger in the despite immense and I think anybody who's kind of followed the situation is well aware of that at this point trust me I am too there are way bigger issues here that I will be discussing and talking openly and honestly about later on in this video I have a few notes in front of me here and I want to make sure that I hit every single point and that I don't miss anything but that being said to get to those issues this did start with vitamins it was kind of the catalyst so I want to make sure we kind of go in order and you guys are able to get the full context and full story of everything if that has happened starting off my friends and I all tend to Coachella weekend one from April 11th through 15th and I had an artist pass provided to me by a brand we had a really really good weekend I mean you guys saw the snapshots Instagram pictures and outfits and my video it was really really fun and we will definitely never forget it but at Coachella I had drama with a boy that I had been talking with for five months prior and it all kind of clouded at the overall memories later on at that very same week on April 19th my best friends and I in the family group chat made the last-minute decision that we wanted to attend Coachella weekend to again to kind of relive those memories but boy free I texted my manager Jake that very same night asking it to be possible to get us in for the next day since it was already Friday we nee were missing the first day of the festival so therefore we could only go on Saturday because it was so at last second we were only able to get VIP tickets which is not the same as artists but we had it over anyway and wanted to have a really really good time for those of you who may not be familiar with Coachella I do want to quickly clarify the different passes just because it kind of is important to this whole situation if the IP although VIP is still very very open to the public artists passes however our passes that you can not buy the only way you can get a hold of them is through a brand getting them from the actual festival or through having a personal connection to one of the artists or bands that are playing it's in a very very highly secured area that is not open to the public a lot of artist passes though there's also something called a performer pass and backstage passes and a lot of other things that can keep you more protected keep in mind weekend one I did have an artist past weekend - I had a VIP going into the situation when we walked into weekend 2 with me my friends on a Saturday April 20th and Sunday April 21st we notice that there was a major major difference and at the crowd we were in the VIP section and I started getting mobbed really really quickly at a super unsafe capacity because as many of you guys know when I've always stopped to take a photo kind of other people tend to come and it just turns into a big situation and it honestly it was not safe I had remembered from weekend one that my friend Nikita driving home is with a lot of the time was brought by sugar bear hair and had an artist pass personal security and backstage passes and was very very taken care of and safe what I felt unsafe in the situation I panicked and I text Nikita and asked her if she had a connection to the sugar bear hair team that could potentially help me out Nikita replied right away and she gave the sugar bear hair team at my personal phone number to which they reached out to me and offered to come rescue me with a pass and backstage access and security to make sure that I was okay and was able to enjoy the festival along with my friends you went to Coachella somehow had a security issue and magically sugar Coachella bear hair is there with a contract in hand to save the day for you and all of your friends no company would ever go out of their way to have an extra you know handful of passes that cost thousands of dollars apiece like just in case that leads me to believe that this was orchestrated beforehand but he had an emotional conflict because of me and promises he made me behind the scenes so he had to come up with a very clever story and didn't tell me right when he got back but after the little bit was posted on their launch day despite we talked you said in her video of this whole situation was definitely not a big scheme that was orchestrated beforehand it really did happen on the spot the sugar bear hair team texted me their proposal right away no money was involved and with no time to negotiate in a panic I signed and that was out on that James Charles he had nine days after Coachella to talk to me on Monday April 22nd which was one day after Coachella I was due to post my stories based on my contract and up until that moment I honestly had not thought about the fact that talk to you was a sugar bear hair a competitor and in that moment I thought that as a friend she deserved a courtesy text to let her know the context on the sponsorship and everything that was going on to not even get a phone call to not even get a text a few days prior but right after that sponsored post went up to have a text like hey mom love you I'm stressed just so you know XYZ I just did this post but it's no big before posting my stories I actually did text 20 first out of respect for her giving her heads up about the sponsorship but she was immediately upset I try my best to kind of explain the entire situation and also gave her a direct apology as well but at this point I had signed the contract and I absolutely had to post it there was no getting out of it I then headed to the airport and took off on a flight to San Francisco by the time that I had landed a one hour later talk to you - uploaded all of her Instagram stories of her crying talking about the friends the community that haven't really supported her how she was alone and how she felt very very hurt and betrayed very quickly people put two and two together and realized that this was clearly about me and I started getting thousands and thousands of tweets and comments and texts about the whole situation throughout the next several hours I made countless attempts at text both Tati and her husband James and many phone calls as well trying to reach them all of which they did not respond to and later on that night while sitting in my hotel in San Francisco because I could not reach talk to you I assured a public apology directly on my Instagram because I really wanted to make sure she saw that I was sorry and I wanted to end the situation by taking full responsibility for my actions over the next several days I made countless attempts to contact both Tati and her husband James on all their different phone numbers I texted and called a Tottie's business number her family number and also James's personal phone number as well after a full entire week of trying to reach out and handle things in private with Tati on her husband James and getting no response I figured at this time it'd be best to just respect their space give them their privacy and that whenever talked to is ready she was reached back out to me to handle things in private and hopefully move on with our friendship that is everything in regards to the Instagram stories that we've talked about that I want to discuss a few of the things and talk to this video that were misleading and false the reason that James always said that he couldn't promote halo on his channel and really do like you know heavy endorsement was because he has a teenage audience and it would just be inappropriate now this thing was just confusing to me mostly because this conversation never actually happened if you guys know my channel you know that I don't really do dedicated product reviews ever which is what Tati is known for but even though that is the case I have still multiple times that talked about her products are almost social media networks I have to worry okay I forgot to say - hello I'm going to a really important event later on tonight my best friend we are going to yes this is true and this is a very important loss to me because it is my best friend - mopti it she's launching something new on HeLa beauty I'm super proud of her by the tennis videos oh it'll already be up so go check it out probably for talk to you love me the most who doesn't need a little beauty boost every now and then - the following statements are real claims made by your original halo beauty booster so oh can I just say I love you guys for putting a Halo question in there as I just receive a package from a halo beauty this is Todd he's a brand-new brand mom I did not tell talk to you that I was buying these going to pay for these myself because I just wanted to support her and I'm so happy because I know she's worked so hard on these for the past several years now congratulations auntie I love you a little you so much I do want to keep this video strictly based on facts and receipts but one of the most hurtful things taki did and her video it was bring up my mom and questions her parenting no tears this time my mom is the strongest woman I have ever met she is kind she is creative and she is caring she is a cancer survivor and she balances a marriage a full-time job and raising two boys absolutely crazy lives she's taught me so much in the past and when I made a mistake she has never turned to public humiliation as a form of punishment all that being said I love my mom and I think she's doing a damn good job if I do say so myself the last phone conversation that James Charles and I had he said some things telling me about a situation that happened in Seattle at my birthday and it literally made me want to vomit oh my god you tried to trick a straight man into thinking he's gay yet again and somehow you're the victim you know it's really disgusting to manipulate someone's sexuality especially when they are still you know emerging into adulthood and don't quite have everything figured out you are using your fame your power your money to play with people's emotions and you're doing that to have them behave sexually in your favor even if they're straight and you know what that's not okay and how dare you laugh about it and make me master meme and retweet and this and that and I love straight boys I love straight boys and make it a joke because this behavior is not normal it's not okay cracking someone's sexuality is not an escape room first of all I am a 19 year old virgin I talk about boys quite a lot My Story of my social media networks clearly at this point and it's not acceptable anymore we're talking about that a little bit I promise you but just thought I would bring it up put it out into the universe I don't really get a lot of action we have probably guessed this at this so that being said I have never and would never and will never use my fame money or power to manipulate or get any sexual actions from a guy that is disgusting it is not me and the fact that Tati brought this up blows my mind because she knows the real story the story that were talking about here is a situation that happened when I was in Seattle for talking surprise party with a boy named Sam now I'm going to tell you the full story since everybody seems to be leaving out literally every single detail in talk to each video she mentioned that she was disgusted and had to apologize to her family for me apparently saying things that I wanted to do to a waiter and then just to find those actions by saying I have a celebrity okay this literally did not happen what did happen is that me Jeffrey Nate - my best friend drew all flew to Seattle to surprise talk to you for her birthday on February 14th that night we went out to dinner with that with Tontine James and her whole family and we're in a restaurant there was a cute boy across the restaurant that I kept making eye contact with and that I was interested in and the conversation of dating for me and Jeffrey both came up the dinner table and we were talking about it for a very very short period of time the conversation never got inappropriate period the boy that was involved in the story is named Sam now when I originally wanted to do this video addressing everything I did plan on crossing his name and keeping him completely private but he has since come out and made a video of his oh not talking about the situation just like talk to you leading out many many details but in his video and in the screenshots that I have Sam mentioned that he was perfectly fine and found the flirting that I was doing flattering so I'm not really sure why this got turned into something much bigger but it simply was not he was looking at me later on that night he started asking me if I had a Valentine this is this was on Valentine's Day where he especially thought that I was very attractive and he wanted to get my phone and all that but the waitstaff at my restaurant didn't let that happen he left and it kind of just went and talked about the Imus Liberty thing is really incredibly frustrating to me because this is an inside joke between my friends and I had that Tati is also participated in and she twisted this to be something far worse than what it is this is the joke that really is where we say I'm famous not I'm a celebrity and it's thing that we don't say it in public very often because without context I get it it looks and sounds really really bad trust me literally famous is synonymous of anything good so yeah my YouTube video does well one day my friends was like oh my god James are so famous but literally if my friend takes a good Instagram photo oh my god you're so famous if our boneless buffalo wings that Chili's are extra delicious one day oh my god these wings are so so famous it has nothing to do at all with fame power or money which is what Tati eluded it to being and it is so frustrating that she turned an innocent and funny inside joke that she has participated in into something so beyond disgusting I'm going to try my best to make it a long story very short the next day Sampson into my DMS first and I happened to see it we started talking back and forth and he mentioned that he was flattered by me flirting with him at the night before head sorry about last night you're very attractive and then I was very flattering actually a few minutes into the conversation I asked about his sexuality and he told me straight up that he was bisexual oh my god you tried to trick a straight man into thinking he's gay there was no straight man at being manipulated anywhere in this story like Tati mentioned later on in the conversation he asked when I was leaving Seattle and I told him the next morning to which he responded I wish we had time to hang out and I said hey why do you come over to my hotel tonight we can watch a movie together he said sounds good later on he messaged me first and told me hey straight up I've never done anything with a guy before I'm a little bit nervous too which I told him there was absolutely no pressure this is all shown in the screenshots Sam showed up at the hotel we watched movies together and we cuddled after the movie I asked him if he wanted to kiss to which he said yes I get to the hotel room we say hi it's all fine we had watching a movie and after that movie he asked to kiss me I said yes and we ended up making out for around an hour and if I'm being honest he's the worst kisser I've ever kissed way too much time all right note taken um after making out Sam for over an hour I did invite him to sleep over at the hotel and he kept telling you to stay like please say please say don't leave me all this knob and I really wanted to go home so I left of course I want to spend more time with him but he said that he wanted to go home and be in his own bed and think about everything that was going on because it was quite a lot and I definitely understood and did not blame him he then left and sent me a message afterwards thanking you for being so understanding and I told him that I would always be there for him if he needed literally anything point being everything that happened in the hotel room was 100% consensual and this is confirmed I said yes by the only two parties that were actually they are being myself and Sam after this night Sam when I continued to talk for the next several weeks at first it was really really great but I noticed that his feelings towards me and sexuality were kind of wavering quite a lot and I came to the collusion that he needed to figure himself out and that I needed to move on because I kept getting hurt last important note to keep in mind about the timeline of the whole situation on May 2nd Sam texted me from his friend's phone saying that he was fully gay I needed to talk to me about something important I called him and instead talking about that he asked me if I was talking to another guy at the same time that I was talking to him I was a little bit confused as to I as being asked this but I did answer him honestly and then I asked him what made him come to conclusion with everything to what she said I'm actually not fully okay after doing this a million times I was frustrated and I hung up just to clarify so there are no further questions the point of including this screenshot is not to out Clarification Sam Sam texted me saying he was fully gay but it was a trap to get me on FaceTime so he could illegally record the conversation to include in the video that he was planning later on like I said at the end of the conversation I asked and how he came to this conclusion and then he told me he was not fully gay to which I hung up out of frustration later on he texted me saying he was confirmed by this is why in Sam's video he included a screenshot of me telling him I did not think he was fully straight this comment had a lot of people really up and confused as to why I was telling somebody their sexuality but there's a very simple explanation Stan when I talked for a very very long time and his sexuality like I said wavered a lot every time that he was a little bit confused we had open and honest conversations about it and he always asked me of my input and I gave it to him I would never out somebody and I have never ever tried to manipulate somebody's sexuality including his point-blank period the whole situation that happened with Sam was very very long and complicated and left both of us very hurt and confused and through trying to do this I reached out to many of my different friends for advice um there was one night in my kitchen where Tatia James and Gabriel all came over and I told them the same exact story and showed them the same exact screenshots to all of you guys just saw after hearing this like Tati said in her video Tati and James actually did have a heart-to-heart conversation with me about the boys that I could involve with they told me that talking to curious guys was going to continue to get me hurt and that also it could look really really bad from an outside perspective if somebody tried to manipulate the situation and for me this is a major major wake-up call that I took to heart because I honestly had never thought about it and any other way because I knew that everything that I was doing was always consensual between both me and the boy and I had receipts to back it up but I wished I knew at the time that Todd his advice was really a warning because she did exactly what she told me someone else may which was telling my story with no details no facts and no proof and twisted around and now serious allegations have surfaced that could permanently damage my career now like I said the talk that happened in my kitchen I really did appreciate because it was the first time I kind of took a step back and was able to analyze what was going on and this week has been a major eye-opener for me as well I want to take a brief moment to talk about boys boys have obviously met a talent that has been discussed quite in detail on my youtube channel and social media networks this is no secret I wish it hadn't been but if I'm gonna talk about at one last time I definitely want to be open and honest with you guys the ones who matter I got out of the closet as gay at age 12 which is honestly really really young to kind of figure all of that out I have two other boys at school at the time who were gay but we were all close friends so nothing was happening there if you know what I mean but all my other friends were having their first kiss underneath the playground slide or getting into their first relationship and talking all about it and for me I was on poptropica and social media networks trying to make friends and trying to find out what else I was interested in I never really got the opportunity to experiment with love and learn from that as a growing teenager and I think that that's honestly left me kind of underdeveloped as a person in a lot of different ways I've been forced to grow very very quickly because of the job that I work in in social media which I know excited million times beforehand but love and relationships is something that I have barely any experience in and I honestly think that that's why I'm a lot less mature than others maybe in the situations that I get myself into um I definitely am emotional and I like it the best me sometimes I can be dramatic I'm reactive I'm forward I'm flirty and these are qualities that I'm not necessarily proud of at all but I can confidently say that with each experience I'm learning more and more and I've been able to better myself but a lot of times these situations have become public my own fault my own fault but having millions of people watching you learn can be very very tricky when it comes to experiences that I've learned from in the past a lot of times I've talked about being in two straight guys now this conversation is saying that has upset and also confused quite a lot of people so in order to provide a little bit more context I would like to play a clip from Todd his friend Jeffrey Starr's video titled the truth about my relationship but a single for a long time and the reason why is because I am really not attracted to anyone but what we call in this world as a straight male or a normal dude and what I mean by that is like you know I am really into straight guys and I know that is going to not be surprising to a lot of you so you know from just travelling everywhere and meeting dudes all the time and being around that world for so long I really kind of fell into a trap of always being someone that was kept like the secret and when you are someone like me who is you know I get asked all the time even every day on my channel you guys I get comments are you a guy are you a girl are you transgender are you trying to transition what are you being someone that is like me that is a guy that looks like a woman right I keep doing this because so many people are not into labels these days and I love that I'm all about that you do you call yourself whatever you want whatever you believe in I think that is the beauty and the freedom of you know living is we can be whoever we want to be I have always been into straight men and the problem with that my entire life is I never found real love because straight men behind closed doors they love people like me they love hooking up they love having fun they love the relationship as long as other people don't know I really like the stuff from Jeffrey's video because not only is everything in it very accurate but I honestly feel like he did a great job of explaining a topic that is very confusing and complex and then not a lot of people understand including me fully to be honest yes as a gay man I am attracted to men and in the past whenever I have found a guy cute on Instagram or on social media I have stood in the dm's of the simple hello or a nice compliment if anybody ever made it clear that they were not interested or were not gay and didn't want to talk I always apologized for the unwanted attention and the conversation was put to a halt immediately I do take full responsibility for sending these messages in this situation has definitely taught me that sending messages that are so for and direct like this are unacceptable and I no longer will do that moving forward a few different guys that I've talked to in the past have since came forward with their stories or posted screenshots of conversations that I had with them saying that I made them feel uncomfortable and reading some of them I honestly felt really really bad I reached out to all the boys directly and apologize to them for my actions but aside from those few guys people are Stereotypes treating a hashtag Jam Chavez over party as an open invitation to add to the narrative with lies which is not only harmful to me but it's also creating very very dangerous stereotypes around the lgbtq+ community for example zara larsson who's a pretty big singer tweeted saying that i messaged her boyfriend multiple times knowing he was straight and this tweak on almost half a million likes before it was deleted in her defense she did later on say there was only one message but it was way too late because the media had already ran with it saying that I was harassing straight men and wouldn't leave him alone had I known that he was dating zara larsson I clearly never would have messaged him in the first place but this is all very hypocritical considering and this is how's our Larson found her boyfriend I'd like to pose a question to you the audience why is it okay for zara larsson a woman with the public platform to tweet these photos of a shirtless man and say who are you where do you live how old are you why are you so fine how do you like your eggs cooked in the morning but for me as a gay man to DM the same person in private with a simple compliment is predatory these stereotypes are on gay men had been and continue to be very very harmful to the community and have been historically used to villainize gay men in society someone completely fabricated a whole entire story about me touching another boy at a high school Journal and it blew up this person that came forward a few days later saying that it was a social experiment but it was too late people also completely photoshopped Twitter DMS of me reaching out to these people threatening legal action if they were to tweet more things when in reality I have literally not even met on social media and I deleted the Twitter app from my phone so all these things are just so false and are so fake and it's truly disgusting also pretty much every boy that I've ever even communicated with at this point is posting screenshots of our conversation at to make a spectacle of me I've dealt with so many fake stories in the past from Coachella the fake sex tape and now this and I'm done I'm done being the subject of these bandwagon stories for length it's not okay now that we've addressed and cleared the air on the boys let's get back to our Thailand because somehow there's still a whole lot more to this story and more claims as well in toc2 video she said that she felt she needed to bring all this to the public eye because people need to just know what's going on behind the scenes and I truly cannot believe that I'm about to bring up what I'm going to bring up but I feel the same exact way on Monday May sex that Jeffrey posted this tweet to his twitter which i honestly started getting tagged in after this tweet and a few other ones from him and his friends i decided to reach out to him and asked if there was something going on and that i should be aware of he replied to me and he said that it was not about me and that it was about another brand stealing his ideas this message was in a voice memo which has since disappeared from the screenshot you'll just have to believe me I have literally no reason to lie at this point even though he said it wasn't about me I still asked to talk to him but he said he was unavailable a few hours later while I was getting ready to forth and back down this text from Jeffrey concerned but mostly really really confused I reached out to him about meeting together in private and hopes to speak together and figure out the best understanding but he didn't reply three days later still no response I decided to reach out again but he was not available to talk I flew to Australia on May 8th and on May 10th hours before my scheduled meeting reappearance where five thousand fans were already waiting outside I was open up at four in the morning by my friend because Tonti had just uploaded a video titled by a sister watching talk to his video it was very clear to me that my friend was still very hurt and even though I had already apologized both privately and publicly I wanted to make a video right then and there with my raw and honest emotions but because of the time difference it took me the extra few hours to film the video and get it up and by the time I was about to hit publish I received an another text from Jeffrey star I've already cleared up Sam and our nights together being a hundred percent consensual he was absolutely not trapped at a hotel room but Jeffrey also brings up Zack Zack is his boyfriend Nate's brother and not only did I not pursue Zack who identifies his mainly straight but it was actually Jeffrey who suggested that I talk to him in the first place maintenance brother is single and mainly strange alright after Ali moved here work Zack and I talked on South chat for maybe a total of 10 selfies parking port to each other he was super super sweet but it was very clear to me that he was not actually interested and the conversation stopped before anything could even get remotely flirty at all with everything going on I did not reply to Jeffrey's text in the moment a few days later on Monday I woke up again in the middle of the night from a phone call my little brother Ian who was very very upset he's only he had tweeted saying why do people act so tough online about somebody from his hometown who was bullying him and a Jeffrey star of all people had quote tweeted Ian's tweet saying why is her brother a predator why don't you really move back to New York City exactly shut the [ __ ] up many people were quick to call out Jeffrey for bullying a kid who had nothing to do with the situation literally at all and he deleted it the tweet after this I went to check my and notice that Jeffrey had texted me a few minutes prior and I opened my phone to this I really want to read this text out loud just so you all get to hear exactly what I had to read but also so I don't miss anything Grayson is going on camera shortly to finally tell the world how you tried to molest him and touch him in his sleep and made him uncomfortable for months you sick [ __ ] next Zach will be going on camera to tell how twisted and sick you were trying to get him to like you and then make him feel bad what he didn't want to send you photos back then Sam from Seattle will be joining me in Cameron to talk about you trapping him in his hotel room you need to be locked in prison for a very long time you need the internet taken away from you you are a danger to society as disgusting as it is I have to admit bringing up Graceland Dolan was pretty clever at the height of all these allegations and stories going around both of the twins unfollowed me not wanting to be associated and fans started speculating that the rumors could be as to why too bad that aside from our pre-planned collaborative jokes that happen did the sisters want videos of me and Grayson flirting nothing ever happened between us and when all this went down I knew Jeffrey was lying because the twins were two of the first people to call me and make sure that I was okay I already mentioned Zach and I still have no idea who the Cameron at Jeffrey's referring to in this message is but he also brought up Sam last who he also already talked about later on that day though Jeffrey was right Sam did upload a video to his YouTube channel telling the whole story he left out almost all the details and included an illegally recorded FaceTime call which was on May 2nd told you'd remember that but even through all of this he still managed to get the point across that our interactions were 100% consensual next was Jeffrey's tweets my little brother Ian now I did say that this video was going to be solely based on facts and I of course can't prove what Jeffrey was trying to imply here and I don't want to put words into his mouth but since it's now open for speculation might as well clear the air he had actually went home for a few different reasons but it's temporary he had to get his with some teeth taken out and he's also working on different modeling opportunities in New York City and I am so incredibly proud of but he was also having a really really hard time in LA dealing with a public breakup and negativity online sent him into diagnosed clinical depression which he is now being treated for and he wanted to be with my parents nothing more last but finally not least Jeffrey posted this tweet claiming he hadn't seen me since February and that Nate banned me from their home now this so-called ban is the first time I'm ever hearing of this and I just think it's really funny that Jeffrey brought this up could starting the fact that he's tweeted me twice and between February and now saying that he missed me regardless he ended that tweet first thing I was a danger to society and everything in takis video was 100% true adding insult to injury not only did Jeffrey texted me but he also went out of his way to text my best friend drew this lovely message trying to turn him against me Jeffrey's messaging about me both in private and in public was hurtful to fam'ly Torrey extremely excessive but most importantly literally all based on lies I wish I knew why he was doing all this but at the same time his track record with public views makes under this a surprise Totti made a video telling stories about me and publicly humiliating me and now I have serious allegations against me that could be detrimental to my career hello future games here popping in again I've been completely honest my whole timeline thus far and I obviously want to keep doing so so I feel like it is only fair to mention that only within the past few days it pretty much everyone involved with this situation has started to reach out to me in some way shape or form say I'm cook the boy from Seattle has called me nine times and sent me a few different text messages about the situation and trying to make things right Totti and her husband James have tried to reach out in order to schedule an meeting but only through a mutual YouTube rep that we share and I'd also heard from that same person that Jeffrey was open to a meeting as well this whole thing has just been really difficult for me because throughout the past three weeks literally all I've wanted and all I asked for was for communication from these people and I tried really really hard to get that and I did it so I declined the meetings because I felt like this was started publicly and it was addressed publicly and I felt like it was only fair for me to address as publicly as well before meeting behind the scenes and talking further that sucks to say because I still have love for these people and I hope that one day we all can sit down together in a meeting for closure and also to discuss how in the future if problems do come up we can talk in private with only us involved but right now I just need time and space to kind of get my head back to where it needs to be and get my mental health back together before I kind of rekindle those friendships because everything that happens still really really hurt and I I like wouldn't wish what I went through upon even my worst enemy no matter how angry I was I've always tried to use my platform to spread positivity but I feel like at this point it's my responsibility to be honest with you guys and tell you that the last few weeks of my life has literally been the most painful time that I've ever had to deal with and my head and brain for a hot minute went to a place so dark that I didn't think that I was going to come back from and I thought I can't believe I just mitad that on camera people always say that being a social-media influencer is an easy job and this is some that I've talked about time and time to time to get on YouTube we get it but I don't think any human being ever is prepared mentally or physically to deal with the pain and anxiety of what it feels like to have millions and millions of people talking to you at one time having to read the hundreds of thousands of tweets and the YouTube videos and the articles about me and my character and my family based on things that were almost all lies like it messed me up it messed me up is the best way that I can put it and through all of this I've learned that if I can get through this I can get through anything joy getting in on bandwagon hate and cancel culture is incredibly incredibly toxic and it's very concerning to me that as a society we're becoming okay with guilty until proven innocent instead of the other way around I truly hope that everyone who participated in this whether it be fans influencers Java channels or credible newest sources take the time to think about your words and the impact that they may have on others because I assure you and I promise you it's a lot stronger than you might you may think right now I have a lot of positive changes that I want to work on in my life first and foremost I really want to focus more on spending time in person with the people that I love and care about the absolute most and I also have a lot of work to do in terms of getting my mental health box where it needs to be what's now when you guys class my parents and little brother just got to LA this morning and we all got to hug and be together as a family for the first time in a while and all my closest friends that are not on my payroll May I an are all here too we're celebrating my birthday next week I'm turning 20 gross many of you guys noticed that the Socialists apparel website was down I was so excited about a lot of the things that not coming very very soon and just the lion in general I am so grateful for all of your guys's love and support on it it was really really fun to work on I also love the team that I worked on it with but unfortunately I had a sever ties with Killer mercs I just don't see a world that exists where I could ever be in business with the team ran by someone like Geoffrey star if you placed an order on the website before it went down everything will still be fulfilled don't worry you'll get your items and if you got a gift card beforehand make sure you hold on to it because the balance will be valid whenever we reopen because we are coming back I promise in regards to the sisters tour which have gone quite a lot of questions about despite the ticket scandal we are almost completely sold out nationwide and that is mind blowing to me and I'm so grateful I know there's been a lot of emails and speculation as of right now I unfortunately do not have a full answer on what is happening with the tour but I will have an update for you guys by the end of this week I promise going on tour has been a dream of mine for so long now and I really want this to happen I just feel like meeting you guys hugging you and just getting to thank you face-to-face for what you've done for me is exactly what I need in my heart right now but at the same time towards a lot and it's a big big commitment and I want to make sure that I know what I'm getting into and that when I walk on stage every night it's with a genuine smile and you guys can feel that and you're able to smile as well so I'll keep you posted as for my youtube channel I decided that I'm gonna be taking some much-needed time away from content production on my last few videos I've definitely noticed quite a lot of comments talking about my ego or my attitude getting the best of me and getting to my head and I appreciate the constructive criticism and feedback and after a lot of reflection I think you're right I've lost focus and that sucks so much but I want to get back to it so badly and I want to get back to my original goal when I have no motivation other than just creating original content and that'll happen for sure and I already have some great ideas in the works but it's just gonna take a little bit of time ask my other social videos I pledge to myself that I'm going to try to power down as much as I can I'm sure I'll be checking here and there of course but I do really want to focus more on in-person time and the people around me that are loving and caring and that includes all of you guys whenever I do come back I don't know what it is but I just cannot wait to show you guys a better person with me I want to end this video today with two things an apology and a thank you to my sisters I'm sorry if I disappointed you and I'm really starting how to watch all this go down you saw a side of me that I'm really not proud of and that I know I need to work on

are as well I think that is all I got at this point thank you for watching if you meet all the way to the end and in the spirit of turning something negative into a positive my sister,On,Original

32,Jaclyn Hill,YouTube,"Jun 13, 2019",My Lipsticks,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8QeSZpr0bs,hey guys welcome back to my channel for today's video I don't even need to give you an intro you know why we are here I want to address some of the issues that my customers are having with my first launch of my brand jackin cosmetics and my lipsticks first and foremost I would let you guys know the basis I'm going to be covering throughout this video I want to talk about the melting issue I want to talk about the white fuzzies I want to talk about the black holes and I want to talk about the grittiness and the texture that you guys are experiencing and give you informed details of what all of these issues are what is causing them and how they are going to be fixed I just want to put that out there before we've been jumping in to the actual video so that you guys know that I'm not gonna run away from this and I know it's Expired taken me a couple days to get all my ducks in a row and get this video out for you guys but I've been going through all the documentation and on the phone with labs and chemists and the owner of my lab and my entire team for several days and doing a very in-depth investigation to figure out exactly what's going on so I can give you the most informed information as a brand owner the first thing that I want to address before anything else is the accusations that my lipsticks are expired moldy or hazardous in any way shape or form I'm gonna put up documents throughout this entire video so you guys can see the actual proof because I'm not gonna sit here and like read papers to you guys I'm gonna put it right through the screen so you can see proof so number one let's start with the expired accusation my lipsticks did not go into mass production until the same month that I actually launched my brand it was only a couple weeks before a couple weeks prior to my launch that we started actual mass production although I had been so in depth with my formulation my colors and approving all of that mass production did not go in to production until right before my Lodge because we wanted them to be fresh we don't the mists own shelves and because my brand has been pushed back so many times I actually already went through the same situation with a different lab several years ago I went into mass production ended up having an issue while in mass production and then didn't launch my brand and had to go to a whole new lab because I didn't want those issues to happen again so I cancelled them and went somewhere else I try to cover my tracks I've dug but they are not expired I know you guys have seen photos of my components all over my socials here and there throughout the last couple of years I've been working on my components for 5 years straight to get it perfect but just because I've been working on a component you guys have seen that does not mean there's an actual lipstick inside of it that I kept on a shelf and sold to you guys just want to put that out there and know my intentions and what's real what's not and give you the facts second Facts of all my lipsticks are not moldy they are not hazardous they are not contaminated they're not unsafe for you in any way shape or form every single ingredient in my lipstick is new and it is FDA approved and again I will give you proof right here if you guys want to look over these documents in-depth and tear them apart you go right ahead and see that they are not contaminated every single ingredient is FDA approved and they are not expired I want to ease your minds with that before even getting into all the nitty-gritty stuff of this video so that you're not sitting here thinking like oh my gosh is it true that if I use this lipstick that it's gonna it's gonna hurt me in some way no that is not the case and now you guys have seen that so let's move forward all right so the first Black Dots thing I want to touch base on are the little black dots or black holes that you guys are seeing what these black dots are are actually oxygen bubbles and they are being lifted to the service when my lipstick bullet is being cooled off when it's going from a hot temperature fresh out of the VAT and it's gonna go into my actual component and just be cooled down so that the component cap can be put on top in that process sometimes those oxygen bubbles don't make it all the way through and you'll see little itty bitty almost like black like holes it's not actually like black holes again it's not mold it is oxygen and it is 100% safe it is not gonna hurt you but seeing those dots are not pretty and they're not like you don't look at that component you don't look at that lipstick and things like oh yeah I want to put this on my lips so if you're experiencing that please contact help at Jacqueline cosmetics comm show us a photo of your product we will send you not only a full refund but we will also give you a brand new lipstick that does not have any of those issues that you're concerned about the second thing I want Texture to touch on is the texture and the grittiness that you guys are seeing in your lipsticks now although this is not happening to everybody it's still happening and basically what this is caused from is the humongous vats it's almost like I always want to use the word beaker but it's not like a beaker or smaller it's like these gigantic huge vats there in labs like this gigantic thing that holds all of your lipstick and it like spins like this and mixes everything up that VAT is not breaking down all my raw materials because we produce so many lipsticks so quickly again all the products in these vats are 100% FDA approved ingredients and totally good and safe for you to use but they're not being broken down small enough and smoothly enough which I take full responsibility for we made a lot of product in a very short amount of time and although we all thought that it was gonna be perfect and fresh that's not the case we move too quickly and because of that the ingredients are not broken down I will say this you're still gonna get the same effect on your lips they're still gonna give you a nice creamy formulation it's still gonna look beautiful once it's applied but it's not pretty to look at and when you apply it sometimes you can feel like a little bit of that texture that greediness and that is so not okay and I want to make that right for you and again I'm gonna reiterate it over and over and over to contact help at Jacqueline cosmetics comm of course I will put that email in the video I'll put it down below contact them all you need to do is show them any proof a video a photo whatever is and we will take care of everything for you and make it right I know a lot of people are like yeah what if people are lying I don't even care like I want to make this right for my customers this is my first launch and it's very embarrassing I'm not gonna make it about myself in any way and tell you how I feel about this but it's embarrassing for me to not see you guys fully happy and I am so so sorry that any of you are experiencing anything less than absolute perfection from my first launch and I will do whatever it takes to make it up for you I will send you a brand new lipstick I will pay for it myself I'll give you a full refund I don't care I want you guys to experience the products that I approved the I love and what I want to create for my brand going forward next let's talk about the white White Fuzzies fuzzies this is the thing that gets me going so when I first heard the definition and the reason for these white fuzzies on some of these lipsticks i 100% did not believe it I got very upset and I was like why are you lying to me why you trying to treat me like I'm an idiot this is ridiculous like I need a better explanation but after thorough investigation we know what the actual issue is and I know that a lot of you guys don't have a hard time believing this because I did as well this is the truth because my lipstick component is a silver shiny almost metal like material MyLab instead of using a standard glob that they would use in the lab they decided to use white cotton gloves they're like fluffy white gloves because they didn't want the standard gloves to put any smears on this component to in any way have any sort of prints on it so they want to do a white fluffy glove first when I heard this I thought but wait how are a couple people wearing white fluffy gob gloves gonna put this many fluffy white little fuzzies all over my products that doesn't make sense right well then once I started seeing videos I started seeing proof and then my team actually did our own investigation it actually made a lot more sense in my mind and I'll tell you guys exactly what that is we have several people up to 20 people working on my lipsticks on the line every single day as they're being produced and every single of those people are wearing white gloves when I tell you guys how many times a day they have to change gloves and put on new ones it's crazy every time I need to take a call they have to step off the floor off the line out of the production area they just take off their gloves and they have to get brand new ones when they walk back in they have to take off their hair nuts they take off their beer nuts they'd replace everything once they come back in they don't get to walk out go to the bathroom put on the same gloves and come back in so when you think about 15 20 people working on a line all replacing their gloves every 30 minutes 45 minutes hour hour and a half it's a lot of brand new freshly white gloves coming in to that region that is spreading lint all over the product not acceptable at all and the second we saw this we changed to different gloves that will not be giving this issue whatsoever on top of that they were cleaning my vats vats which is the big humungous bucket that has my batches inside of it they were cleaning those and vats with like this white fiber almost towel going through it and that's been happening about once a day they said two sometimes twice a day depending how quickly we're moving through batches so those two things combined that is what you were experiencing our little white cotton fibers coming off of their gloves and it is so beyond unacceptable and I'm so sorry this happened to you guys and for obvious reasons we will no longer be making any more products with this lab because that's just not what you guys deserve so again contact me and my team we will get you a full refund and a new perfect bullet that does not look like that but let me just say this it is not harmful for you this is not in any way harmful it's just little white cotton fuzzies that come from a very sterile environment still not okay but as much you guys know that if it doesn't bother you it doesn't bother you like I've had several people contact me they're like oh I don't care it's white and often use it and I'm like that's fine but still it's not perfect and it's not what I want for my product so contact Jacqueline Cosmetics and we will figure it out and we'll make it right melting issue last thing I want to talk about the melting issue and even though you guys are seeing a lot of stuff all of our social media like when I log on to social media I'm just like oh my god but from the backend of my brand and actually looking at emails the biggest issue and the biggest complaint is actually the melting issue it's actually 80% of our complaints is melting and I know it's crazy right you would think that like the grittiness and all that other stuff but no all the other stuff is only 20% which is insane because social media is so loud and out there and it looks like it's so aggressive and so terrible but behind the scenes of what I'm seeing I'm like alright please contact me if you're having an issue reach out like I want to fix it for you you know like I want to prove myself to you and I thought that I was gonna do that when I first launched but I and I made mistakes and for that I am so sorry but please allow me to help make this right for you anyways about the Melting situation which is about 80% of complaints like I said people are receiving some lipsticks in the mail and then they pull them out they twist them up they swatch them they break they break in the center is you twist them up all the way they'll break at the face which is pretty standard even if you don't have a melted lipstick if you roll all the way up and you swatch it chances are if it's an emollient base lipstick it's going to break at the base so make sure that when you use your lip sticks you do not roll up fully all the way when you are using it just a side note but what people are experiencing is it's showing up in the mail and it's almost having like a little sweat mark like a little like circular sweat mark or like little like sweat dots and then when you swatch it the lips it kind of leans to the side and then it's got like a little little line on it because it's a very creamy very emollient based product so you really have to make sure that it's fully cooled down before using it we did an extensive tests on my lipsticks and shipping from here to there and all this jazz but because of the climate right now we are shipping to some people who are in such hot temperatures and such high degree that my lipsticks they're not surviving it fully my testing actually came out to about 140 degrees Fahrenheit which means that my specific lipstick can withstand 140 degrees before actually melting all the way through which is a very high temperature but once these lipsticks are getting onto trucks that are you know a hundred degrees on the inside these UPS trucks and then they're sitting outside of people's houses up their front doors while they're at work and then they come home and they pull it out yes they're not fully melted all the way through and just like a puddle inside but yeah they might have a little sweat dots on them when you swatch them they might kind of lean to the side so please give your lipsticks enough time to fully cool off before you go in and apply it we are working on a solution for that for you guys right now though so that again you're not dealing with anything that's gonna dis satisfy you like I just want to make sure that you guys are happy that's all it matters to me and if there's anything I'm not covering in this video that I haven't seen on social media please again contact my team and I and we will take care of you now that I have been like spazzing going through all of this because I'm just so eager to get this video up I really just want to take a moment to genuinely thank those of you who have reached out to me telling me what's going on and everyone on Twitter and Instagram who are genuinely sending me photos like asking me and concerned I am very grateful for your honesty I'm very grateful for you coming forward and telling me what's going on because I want to fix this and I would never know if you guys didn't keep me informed so I want to say thank you very much to everybody who has come forth because I did an interview about my brand a couple months ago and that's what I said in this interview I said that my number one thing is I want my subscribers to be honest with me I want them to tell me genuinely what they feel about my product so that I can I can continue to take your information and move forward with it and give you the best products that you guys could receive like that's very important to me and I'm very sorry that this launch was not absolutely 100 percent perfect with a bow on it but we will make it right for you and going forward we will no longer be experiencing these experiences that we are having and we are taking drastic measures to change that and make sure that everything is amazing for you I actually have had to pull several launches because I was doing them with this lab that I had coming up and had to change labs on several different products so there's gonna be a slight delay and some things later on but that doesn't matter like I just want to make sure that you guys are receiving the best of the absolute best so in the future even if you choose not to be a Jacqueline Cosmetics customer even if you lose trust in me that's okay like I understand I promise you guys all around the board perfect products and not all of them were all around the board a perfect product so I get it but I'm going to work very hard and I'm gonna work very diligently to make sure that within the next couple of months within the next year you're gonna look at my brand and be like oh wow this actually is good like she actually corrupted her air and she learned from her mistakes because it's exactly what I'm going to do and I'm so sorry for anyone who received anything less than perfect I take full responsibility this is my brand with my name on it and my team that I've created and I am so sorry that you've received something that is not exactly how I describe it to you so that's it I love you thank you for watching thank you for listening thank you for understanding contact help at Jacqueline cosmetics calm and we will be back to you shortly I love you so much and I'll be seeing you soon,On,Original
33,Marques Brownlee,X,"November 13, 2024",,https://x.com/MKBHD/status/1856456570420257166,"Last video I did something pretty stupid. You might've already seen it, but maybe not so I'll address it here. There was a clip with the action cam of me test driving a car and going way to fast. Absolutely inexcusable and dangerous.

I've since cut it out of the video with YouTube's editor tool. I also understand that this looks like covering it up, but I think it's the right thing to do.

There's no reason to leave that clip in (there was no reason to include it in the first place) and I would never want to make it seem ok by leaving it in the video. I'm well aware of the Streisand effect, and I know everything on the internet lives forever, but I think that's the best decision right now.

All I can do apologize and promise never to do anything close to that stupid again. That's a terrible example to set and I'm sorry for it.",On,Original

35,Colleen Vlogs,YouTube,"May 13, 2020",addressing everything,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5AsmKUSaQg&t=21s,hey guys i know this is not my typical video that you are used to seeing but recently some things have come up that i feel like i need to address and so i just wanted to sit down and have an honest conversation with you and address everything at once so let's get started first thing i want to talk about is something that is weighing the heaviest on my heart right now the video has resurfaced of my sister and i from 14 years ago we are teenagers and in this video we are doing characters that are latina and the characters are completely based on racial stereotypes it is not funny and it is completely hurtful i am so ashamed and embarrassed that i ever thought this was okay i was a sheltered teenager who was stupid and ignorant and clearly extremely culturally insensitive racial stereotypes are not funny they are not a joke and they should never be joked about a few years later we realized how stupid and hurtful the video was and we deleted it not out of fear of getting caught but out of fear that someone would find it and it would hurt them because it's wrong i have grown and learned so much from my ignorant mistakes as a teenager and i've done everything i can to right my wrongs now this video was brought to light right after i had posted a video on my vlog channel last week with my friend todrick talking about racism and how it is still very much a problem in our world today and how we need to fight against it people were saying how dare i talk about racism when i said these things 14 years ago and to you i say that is the exact reason why i should be talking about racism and why i should be standing up against it because i was one of the dumb ones who said that stupid thing and grew from it and learned from it and realized how hurtful it could be and now i want to write my wrongs and make a difference so that other people don't make the same mistakes that i made when i was a kid another video popped up recently that i want to address and it's a video that i filmed 12 years ago where i talk about taking a flight and an overweight woman sat next to me and i talk really negatively about her and it's awful and i watched this clip and i was appalled and shocked that those things were coming out of my mouth 12 years ago because that is not the woman who i am today i'm such a huge advocate for women and women's bodies and loving every shape and every size and the fact that i talked negatively about someone who was overweight is absolutely disgusting to me something else i want to talk about that has been brought up is that when i was three years old i was bit by a dog i needed to go to the hospital and when my mom told the doctor that a dog had bit me the doctor said that legally the dog needed to be put down now the clip of me that is circulating from seven years ago is me talking about this situation in a very insensitive way when in reality when our dog was put down i was really upset and over the years i have addressed this a few times in videos talking about how guilty i feel how upset i am that this happened still to this day as a 33 year old woman i feel guilty that our dog had to be put down for biting me but in this clip i talk about the story in a very dramatic silly way because sometimes unfortunately i use humor to talk about things that are actually extremely painful for me and this is an example of that to anyone and everyone who is hurt or offended by the statements i made when i was younger i am so so sorry i hope you all can see that the person who i am today is so far from that ignorant person i was over a decade ago and to those of you who might say well i knew better when i was that age or 14 years ago i knew right from wrong i'm so glad that you did because that means that there's one less person making those stupid mistakes that i made i should have known better and i didn't and i'm extremely embarrassed by that i'm really hopeful that i can be used as proof that people can change and grow and learn from their mistakes if you continue to speak up when you see someone doing something or saying something wrong it can make a difference as i grew up i learned that those words were hurtful and i stopped using them but there are still people in our world currently who are saying racist homophobic sexist body shaming things that need to stop they need to be called out because they can change i'm living proof of it and my ignorant words from my past just make me that much more passionate to help the people that my words might have hurt these things are being brought to light because some people are upset with me for not addressing something that happened a few weeks ago someone had made a video saying some shocking and hurtful things about me and a lot of you wanted me to address it and i didn't i didn't address it not because i was just ignoring it and hoping it would go away but because when this person messaged me letting me know they were upset i responded immediately i was very shocked and confused i expressed i didn't know what they were talking about and i also expressed frustration that they were trying to bring my son's name into their drama then i received a message from this person's mother asking me to not speak his name so i was trying to respect the mother's wishes and the parents wishes of this 17 year old but it has gotten to a point where there are so many rumors and lies and speculations going around i feel like i need to address it i do have receipts proving the things that i'm about to tell you however i feel uncomfortable sharing them because he is a minor so i'm only going to be showing you the things that were between adults or things that were already public the biggest issue that came from his video is that i sent a child underwear and wow anyone who heard this out of context and was offended i completely understand because i would be too but in this situation context is everything so i would like to give you some context to this situation four years ago i did a live stream and in this live stream i did a giveaway i was giving away clothes that were unused tags still on brand new that i had just bought but i did not want one of the items that was in this box was a really ugly pair of underwear as soon as we pulled them out cory and i started laughing and joking around about how ugly they were why did i buy these ridiculous underwear it was so stupid i just got a big old box from forever 21 and i want to open it up in front of you guys maybe i'll send the ones i don't want to you guys i got a bunch of crop tops the panties the panties and people started asking for them in the live stream who wants that brawl you want the bra everyone wants the bra at the end of the livestream i was done giving away clothes and then this boy who made this video about me recently he asked for the underwear yeah we picked people i think that's enough did that boy win these or not i don't know he has to tell me what he wants what he says he said um hi you have ugly clothes but i want those ratchet panties and bra signed by cory because he modeled them well it was so ridiculous and funny we laughed about it and i forgot to send them to him and eventually he tweeted me asking me for them again i sent them to him he put them on over his clothes and posted about them it was like a big joke within the fandom i did this publicly that live stream is still up right now and i've always given out weird random things in live streams i've given out a taco costume i've given out old bobby pins dirty shoes a few weeks ago i sent a fan like a single piece of toilet paper i've always given away weird stuff and so in my mind at the time this was no different than all the other weird stuff i send to my fans as a joke now in hindsight i see how completely stupid of me i should have never sent that i don't know what part of my brain was missing at the time that i thought oh this is a normal silly thing to do i should have realized and recognized how dumb that was and never sent it to him no matter how much he asked but it was never a sneaky creepy gross thing that i was doing in secret it was a silly stupid mistake that now is being blown way out of proportion he also mentioned in his video that his mom was uncomfortable with me which was surprising and shocking for me to hear because i was always under the impression due to the things he told me and the things that i saw on the internet that she not only was aware of our interactions but she was very supportive of him being a fan of mine she commented on a photo of him this year at my show saying how it was such a fun night she gave him a birthday card when he was 16 with me on it and he let me know multiple times how much his parents loved me and watched my videos so this was surprising for me to hear because if i had known that i would have stopped all interactions with him if i ever knew his parents were uncomfortable another thing i think is important to address from his video is that he did have access to my miranda sings twitter account for one day not for years and i want to just go over how that whole situation went down over the years i've loved asking my fans for advice on what i should post for miranda videos miranda tweets things like that quite honestly you guys are the funniest people that i know and i love your advice i love your input i've taken a handful of suggestions as to what i should tweet as miranda from my fans over the years and he is included in that i used a couple of his tweet ideas many years ago they did really well he was super funny and since then he's asked me multiple times if he can help me out with social media again i always thought that was really really sweet but most of the time i did not engage in those conversations until recently a couple months ago he reached out to me and brought up the fact that the miranda accounts hadn't been as active as they used to be and how he wanted to help me do more social media stuff so he sent me a whole bunch of edited photos that he had in a folder ready to go for miranda he told me about a bunch of funny tweets he wanted to post and he let me know that he had experience working in social media he really vetted for himself and because i'd known him for so many years i was over exhausted and i don't have all the time i used to have to run on my social media i thought you know what this might be a good situation to test run this and see if this could work out this wouldn't be the first time i had hired a fan i love hiring my fans for many reasons one they're super freaking talented two they know me better than anybody and three i love supporting their dreams and passions in any way that i can i've hired my fans to design merch i've hired fans to go on tour with me i've hired fans to edit things for me and how hiring my employees works is i usually do a little test run to see how it goes if it goes well then i hire them officially through my company and they are paid legally through the corporation it was no different for him i wanted to do a little test run if it went well then i wanted to hire him so i gave him access to my account and he started tweeting stuff for me and pretty quickly there was a tweet that was posted that was problematic this was my fault he sent me a very long list of a ton of different things he wanted to post and i did not look over it closely enough i did not review it closely enough i remember the moment when i saw all these things i was breastfeeding my son and i kind of just scrolled through i was like yeah go for it have fun i trust you and when he posted it i put zero blame on him at all it was my fault i knew better than to let someone else tweet for me i should have reviewed closely every single thing that was going to come out of miranda's mouth i let him know that i loved him he did a great job it was my fault not his i publicly apologized for the tweet i deleted the tweets that were posted that weren't posted from me i let him know that i was upset that people were disappointed in me and then he said he logged out of the account and that was the end of it that was the last i heard from him until he sent me the message saying he was really upset with me and that is when i then responded and got the message from his mom i care about him so much just like i care about all my fans that i've interacted with over the years and i wish him nothing but success and happiness and love i don't know what he's going through right now but i don't want him to hurt anymore he made it very clear in his video that he wants to move on from this and be separated from this whole situation so let him have that and let me have the same it absolutely breaks my heart to see people saying negative things about me interacting with my fans based on this situation i love talking to my fans i love interacting with my fans my fans are many different ages so yes there are some teenagers but there's also adults i love supporting them supporting their passions learning about them in the same way that you like to do that for me to me you aren't just my fans you're my friends we all have seen me cry way too many times on this channel about things i probably should have kept to myself i definitely over share and i have definitely over shared with fans when they have asked me what's wrong or ask me how i'm feeling or try to console me when i'm feeling down i definitely have overshared in the past with them and talked with them a little too much when i should have kept things to myself or talk to family or close friends instead there are plenty of other stupid mistakes i've made in my past that i've learned from and grown from there are plenty of other jokes i've made in my career that seemed appropriate at the time but now i realize we're never appropriate to begin with i've learned from these things and i will continue to learn from them and grow from them to become the best me that i can possibly be i've lived my life on the internet for you guys all to watch for over 12 years i love my job but one of the difficult parts of my job is that i am very much put underneath a microscope and any and all mistakes i ever make are definitely shown and blasted to thousands and sometimes millions of people all over the world that's not an easy thing to deal with however i'm really grateful for that over the past 12 years you guys have been really wonderful helping me learn and grow to be a better person you've given me helpful critiques educated me when i was ignorant told me how to say things more appropriately and i can't even tell you how grateful i am for that because of you i have become a better person the person i am today as a 33 year old mother is not the person i was when i started youtube so many years ago but over the last month i've received a lot of criticism that isn't the type of constructive criticism i've received over the last decade it is more just hateful and cruel and the things that are being said about me are absolutely horrendous no i should have never sent a fan underwear how stupid am i no i definitely should have never given him access to my twitter account and no i shouldn't have talked to him as often as i did but i am not a monster i am not a groomer and i shouldn't kill myself be careful with the words you choose to use because i have learned time and time again that words definitely matter and your words can hurt people and they can affect people in a very negative way and i just hope that that's a lesson we can all learn in this situation i never meant to cause anyone who feels affected by this any pain we're in the middle of a global pandemic and it is scary and i just want to say i am so sorry if this situation made any of you feel more stressed or uncomfortable or sad than you already do because of all the horrible things that are currently going on in our world i love you guys thank you so much for taking the time to watch this and i will see you very soon,On,Original
36,Tana Mongeau,YouTube,"Sep 5, 2020",a long overdue apology (youtube.com),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwLiy4ti9is&list=PLqkz-pvmNGHOl3Kw_quVf3v9PyNH4cTJL&index=14,first and foremost i want to apologize for how long this video has taken there is no excuse reason or thing i could say to make that okay and i want to take full accountability for that however i understand that my actions even over the past few weeks have not been hand in hand with accountability and that's a journey that i'm beginning with this video i also understand what the white privilege that i possess i have no right to ask or expect forgiveness from anyone that i have hurt with my actions over the past few months i've seen the explosive effects of what running from your problems can do and how many people you can hurt by doing that but i'm aware that making this video about my emotions would do nothing but be another selfish and careless action and further the problem i want to apologize from the bottom of my heart for being such a big part of cancelled culture for the entirety of my career i don't deserve a platform if i continue to act in such a gaslighting and irresponsible manner and i'm so sorry for how long i've done that i could sit here and blame it on the people i watched or the people that raised me or the advice that i chose to take but at the end of the day i chose to take those paths i chose to only listen to yes people i chose to idolize people that taught me the complete wrong way to handle the responsibility of this platform and it breaks my heart that it took me getting to 22 years old to realize that with that being said i want to express my utter disgust with every single apology video i've ever made i'm sorry for uploading them i'm sorry for defending them and i'm sorry for putting them out to such a huge audience i did nothing but look at apology videos as people digging up my past again if i'd spent the time i spent pandering deflecting making excuses and spewing ignorance to millions of people becoming a better person i would be in a far far better place right now and for that i can only hold myself accountable it is far past the time i needed to own up to my behavior and take 100 accountability for my actions and if i had wanted people to see that i'd truly groan you'd think that my actions would have been in unison with that thought before this moment i want you to know i'm aware of that and i am so sorry for how much of a coward i have acted like that it's inexcusable it's completely completely inexcusable one thing i've learned over this time is the undeniable responsibility that goes hand in hand with a platform of this size i am so sorry for everything i can possess all that i have without acknowledging the extreme responsibility that comes with it i had every single resource to change and i'm so sorry for choosing the wrong route every single time i have so much work to do on myself to become a better person and i intend on showing you that with action education and time i don't want to come back to this platform until i am someone that can shape the youth in far better ways than the things i watched growing up shaped me i don't want to be the reason that a young girl grows up the way i did what would have been vital at that time was to look inside to ask myself why people were angry at me go to the root of the problem and find out why i was acting like that and then educate myself that's what someone deserving of a platform of my size would have done the only goal i was taught that i actually internalized was that when i was in the wrong i needed to make people like me again versus what i could do to become a person that people actually like i see so clearly now the microaggressions and terrible values that i was enveloped in for 15 years of my life i see so clearly now the problem with the things i grew up thinking were funny and the sense of humor i developed i now realize that the content i put out into the world and who i am has the ability to aid in either positively or negatively shaping this generation but with all of that being said there is no excuse for the amount of time it took me when i had every single resource in the world to become a better person in the last three years i had people like colin barry specifically call me out and try to open my eyes and make me better but i was so stuck in my narcissistic egotistical ways that i was convinced i was a good person and had nothing to learn and to anyone who tried to help me during that time and i chose to look the other way i'm sorry especially colin barry i am so sorry you truthfully tried and you would have saved me a whole lot of hell had i listened to you and i want you to know that i know that and i live with that i have a lot more to say about the culinary situation i just wanted to say that right then and there because i felt that that needed to be said next i want to apologize for every single one of my past tweets they were incredibly prejudiced racist homophobic and unfunny it shows how much hate was so clearly inside of me that i thought it was okay even at that time to write that out and put that out into the world and then every time i spoke about my past i pandered i deflected i made excuses and i was so much more of a piece of [ __ ] and it's crazy that i was trying to convince people i'd wrong and that is exactly how i should have apologized any time anyone ever questioned my past as i would grow in my career i would claim to say that i understood the pain behind these words i would claim to say that i knew how wrong it was to have said that at that time but then every time i would apologize it would be in a way that was so pandering and deflecting it would discredit everything i had to say and it's so sad that i was so [ __ ] stupid and couldn't realize that and then i would proceed to spend the next three years in such an unproductive cycle wondering why these things kept getting brought up but how could i expect anyone to forgive me in general if my apology wasn't even a sufficient apology i selfishly decided time and time again i do not need education and for that i am so sorry clearly even based on my actions over the past few months i have so much more growing to do and i understand anyone who is fed up and tired sick of it and doesn't want to be around for that had a person of color done one-tenth of the antics i had done in my career they would not have gotten to act with such privilege in the ways that i did and to every single person who has called me out on my performative activism you are 100 right it is so sad that it took me years to realize that by not apologizing and not taking accountability for my past but then sprinkling in random acts of justice that is performative activism completely you cannot cover up years of damage and being a hurtful person with a cardboard sign and a [ __ ] twitter name and again the fact that it took me this moment in time to realize that is so sad to take this long to make so many people feel heard while thinking i was doing my justice by posting about black lives matter or brianna taylor was performative activism completely and for that i am so sorry i know where my morals lie but i know that my actions have not coincided with them i want to be the best ally activist and friend i can possibly be and role model but acting like this has been the exact opposite of that i can never even fully resonate with the pain and anger people must have felt seeing that i have always only judged people based on the content of their character and not the color of their skin but for so long i thought that was enough and i realize now that that is not enough in any way but if a person of color feels that your actions were racist or you said something that was racist it is about holding yourself accountable and expressing to people that you are wrong and you are sorry and that is not who you are like how did i ever expect people to think that that wasn't who i was if i could never be fully accountable until this moment next i want to address the colin berry and simplyness situations once again the amount of time this is taken is completely inexcusable and i take full accountability for that i let my anger ego and pride stop me from doing what was right and in turn i hurt and let down and made so many people feel unheard including colin nessa and all of their fans and for that i am so so sorry i didn't know what microaggression was and never bothered to educate myself or see any of the validity in the things that were being brought to light before my eyes because i was so convinced that i simply wasn't a racist person and had nothing to learn when i first started reading about microaggression i came across an analogy and the analogy was that there was an empty plane and two african americans got on the plane and they sat in the fourth row two caucasian men enter and they sit in the first row of the plane the plane fills up entirely except for some seats in the back before the plane is about to take off the stewardess realizes that the weight is distributed unevenly and asks the african-american men that sat down first to move to the back of the plane seeing as they sat down first it is entirely micro-aggressive to choose them to have their seats demoted even when i was reading analogies like that i was thinking to myself damn i'm not micro-aggressively racist i don't know what colin and nessa are talking about i would never do something like that but then i think back to all of the times that colin specifically tried to make me a better person tried to help me understand why i was going through these scandals over and over again tried to intensively educate me on the pain behind the words that i'd said and i chose every single time to look the other way not listen and write him off as someone who was just in my ear and wanted to call me out i can't even imagine how angry and in awe he must have felt working with me and seeing me think this way i chose every single time to take the narcissistic route to denote that i was a good person and i simply wasn't racist and that's just how things were and looking back that is so incredibly micro aggressive the way that i must have hurt him with my actions time and time again is so incredibly micro aggressive and that is not a person that i ever want to be even looking back and accepting that truth that this person perceived my actions as my progressively racist makes me [ __ ] sick because that is someone i never want to be but in order to say that and have anyone ever believe me or to even simply just grow it is about holding myself accountable as a white person if a person of color ever accuses you of microaggression the right thing to do is apologize because who am i to decide if i made that person feel that way the fact that i ever thought i could decide that is [ __ ] wrong and who was i at that time to be writing off anyone as annoying or not a good person i was so uneducated and had no right to be shaping or in charge of anyone else and for that i take full accountability and i'm still sorry i've apologized for that i obviously realized that very soon into the trash channel and followed all of my networks protocols to end it properly there's a lot of hearsay as to how that ended if at any point people want to discuss it further i want questions answered i will answer that with receipts and full accountability i just feel that this video should not be related to anything other than my racist actions and past it's so sad that i could never say that i was so unafraid to use racial terminology but i was so afraid of people calling me a racist i had so many chances to say all of this before right now when it comes to the nested situation i feel that it is more complicated and that is definitely one of the reasons that it has taken me so long to address this because i haven't really known what to say however that is not an excuse and this situation has gotten completely out of hand and it is entirely my fault i could have addressed this like an adult and someone who deserves this platform months ago i truly feel that nessa and i had a lot of personal conflict that we were fighting just as caddy teenagers who are 16 and in high school would at that time the average 16 year old girl is going in and out of friendships is meeting people she doesn't like is not getting along with people and that is truly even to this day when i look back at vanessa's situation how i see it regardless i need to be a good example to my followers and if this person is accusing me of microaggression i need to hold myself fully accountable and apologize for ever making her feel that way and let you know that i'm not going to act in that manner in any way for the entirety of my life but at the same time if for some reason something like this is ever brought up it is about holding myself accountable immediately and apologizing i still want to apologize for making you in any way feel that i was acting microaggressive who was i at that time to write off if someone was a good or bad person who was i at that time to be a [ __ ] to someone else to be a bad friend to handle the situation immaturely there's never a point that i feel i was ever treating you in any way based on the color of your skin however if you feel that that is why i treated you that way again i want to say i'm sorry and take accountability for the action because that is the right thing to do i also completely validate your frustrations nessa seeing me get so many things so easily that were probably so much more difficult or impossible for you i should have spent the entirety of my career acknowledging the immense white privilege i have had educating myself on that when people wanted to talk to me about it i will use this information to fuel a fire under me to assure that i am a part of the change and not the problem in this industry when it comes to the anecdotal drama of both of those situations i will answer any further questions with full accountability and receipts in any upcoming ways that you would like me to lastly i want to apologize to each and every one of my fans for letting you down people have really been referencing this time as the time they chose to understand or the time i was canceled for good but i look back at my values across so many of the things i was doing for the entirety of my youtube career and this time has made me realize how skewed they have been all along once again i don't want to make this video about me or my emotions or my family or the way i was raised or that i'm in a dark place right now because like i've said i've had the resources to fix all of that for so long and have chosen not to so it's no longer a feel sorry for me i was raised in this way i was this person it's you should have used all the [ __ ] [ __ ] you have to become a better person and so i know now that when i say things related to my upbringing i'm not saying them in any type of victimizing way or pity party way because you should not feel sorry for a 22 year old who has chosen to not help themselves for so long you know but when i look back at the values that i was instilled with and the way that i was brought up and the way that i then went to project that onto the world it makes me so sick when i think about a single one of my young fans growing up or acting in the ways that i did it makes me sick i am so sorry for thinking for so long that i never had to be a role model i promise you for the entirety of my career i will take that into account with every single piece of content i choose to further make i want to make a difference in a way that is positive and impactful not performative and disruptive at the same time i fully understand the people that have stopped their journey with me or stopping here but for me this is just a new chapter of my journey with myself and becoming a better person i still have to look in the mirror and i want to see someone i'm proud of looking back at me this is my last apology video ever and i am so sorry for the [ __ ] hell i've put you through with these over the past few years if i'm called out for something i will be unashamed of my mistake and hold myself accountable right then and there i will strip my ego and i will apologize i will actually mend the problem versus continuing to shove it down further i don't care if i'm starting every vlog with what i did wrong in the last one and how i'm going to be better in the future once and what i'm going to do right now with my platform to try to make up for my mistake i refuse to run from who i am any longer because i see what that can do if someone is hurt with my actions i realize it is imperative to make them feel heard immediately i will make sure to be aware of the privilege i have as a white creator and do everything i can to be a non-performative ally from this point further i need to continue to focus my energy not on fighting the old but building the new while i've worked on ridding so much hatred inside myself and i know i'm not 2013 tana it is so apparent to not only me but all of you that i have a lot more deep rooted growing to do as a person what i can assure you is that every single day i'm taking active measures such as therapy education and assessing the character of not only myself but everyone i am surrounding myself with in order to grow and become a better person i am so sorry to my fans that i never gave a proper apology to that i gaslit and that i chose to not educate i use such a great platform so irresponsibly in so many ways i refuse to come back to this channel unless i am changing into a person down to the core that is deserving of this responsibility the things that go wrong with us in our lives have the biggest potential to become a part of our gift to the world however at any given moment we all have the power to decide that this is not how our story is going to end i'm starting this chapter by donating to the charities that are listed on the screen and linked below going out and registering to vote and voting for joe biden and encouraging each and every one of you if you are able to be a part of the change that is so desperately needed in america right now everything that every single one of us young people do is incredibly critical to our future even taking the spotlight off of everything that is going on and talking about myself and what's going on in my life for the past 25 minutes is still not okay from this point on i will be using my voice to urge each and every one of you watching and following me to join me in voting to get trump out of office the things that he is doing every single day are so incredibly inhumane and i want to use my voice and platform to let every single one of you know that if you are watching this that you have a choice to help our future be better and i want to start by doing that thank you for watching,On,Original
37,Pyrocynical,Youtube,"Dec 19, 2020",My response,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C0SckVqH2g&list=PLqkz-pvmNGHOl3Kw_quVf3v9PyNH4cTJL&index=27,i'm going to use this video to address the allegations made against me recently to those who are unaware i've been accused of grooming a 15 year old boy when i was 19. that i'm some kind of predator and was aware of his age all along this is categorically untrue and a complete lie the supposed proof for these insane allegations is paper-thin and embarrassingly wrong i originally made a response on my subreddit and i truly believe the evidence i provided was enough and for a time it was but a few days ago a poorly written google doc has surfaced claiming that i have lied in my response and i'm 100 guilty i just want to be clear i have never lied at any point this document is disingenuous manipulative and it fails to include so much of my original statement bringing new information to light but also making points to prove my guilt that i already proven to be untrue in my first statement it's managed to fool so many people like i see video after video of people now saying that i'm a liar and he claims here that pyro could have actually been lying in his response here they already kind of have this notion that he did it and he's not responding so it looks pretty guilty on his part to a lot of people too now this is the main part of the google doc that really set me off i believe this piece of evidence is enough to say pyro is in the wrong whether pyro does respond to everything or just pulls the mini lad and ignores it for as long as he can is still up in the air this document makes like insane assumptions based on limited and broken evidence it's not hard to dismantle it it's just annoying that i have to be the one to do it for those who haven't read the entirety of my original response let me give a little background when i was 19 and 20 i like to take part in this degenerate furry role play with pretty much anyone that would reciprocate and looking back on it now the word cringe that doesn't nearly do enough justice to how sad this all was these conversations never led to any nudes being exchanged it was just purely fantasy garbage something which ivory himself confirms did he ever ask you for nudes no no what these people look like their gender these weren't variables like i could have been doing this with a 90 year old cave troll and it wouldn't have made a difference it was role play after all you're just pretending now it turns out my accuser ivory one of the people that i've had these conversations with was 15 that is three to four years younger than i was it was entirely my responsibility to verify his age before having these conversations and the fact that i didn't that is so incredibly negligent of me to do so i may have been young myself but still old enough to know better but let me be very clear i had absolutely no idea that he was 15. i absolutely did not lie in my original reddit post and i would like to emphasize that ivory himself did not disclose to me directly that he was 15 and the evidence itself supports this too up until september this year i'd be perfectly cool with him we were still speaking and still on very good terms however for one reason or another he felt the need to come out about these allegations to expose that i'm a sexual predator i took advantage of him and i knew his age all along this is all untrue and i am amazed how out of proportion this is all blown up several of our conversations were leaked online by ivory here's one of the more uh damning ones i'd love for my sona to be looking at his fat sweaty ass while rubbing his belly from behind and then just having him gas all over my sona's face that would be so nice or if mine was just underneath him getting railed underneath his huge belly and your sona could be gassing non-stop as he [ __ ] mine like huh well to be honest i'd pick you up hug you to be well to be honest i'd pick you up hug you while rubbing you against my huge sweaty moobs then kiss your cheeks telling you how much i loved you and then kiss you on the lips and let out a hard long belch into your mouth [Laughter] come on literally deviantart here my god he's provided a lot of proof like this to show how much of a degenerate i was and i mean i agree you know you got me now the whole world pretty much knows what i jerk off to but what he and no one else has done is come close to substantiating how this constitutes as grooming ivory himself even struggles to explain how what i did was grooming um how how were you groomed because you don't need to be groomed for this to be wrong is it really fair that you that you use the word grooming and if you if if that's true if you feel that's true where was this going i see i'm not like i don't know i i was in a call with my friend when i like typed it out and i typed like i remember i typed that and asked like is that okay because it reads more like a youtube like thumbnail do you honestly believe did you not understand the definition of the word i i feel like it was like forcing uh or like manipulating the child into a like sexual situation okay yeah that's what that's what that word means to me to disprove this i'd actually have to see something to disprove but there's there's literally nothing it's a blanket statement of pyrocynical groomed me the only thing i can possibly think of is inviting him and a bunch of other people to an event in the uk and somehow this got spun as me buying him a plane ticket to fly him out to have sex with him even even if he lied which can't be proven a 20 year old guy flying a 16 year old boy out to [ __ ] him in england um i don't care what the lies most people find that disgusting and that's why pyro's losing uh sive pewdiepie's editor is one of the many people i invited to this event and he agrees the claim is just complete [ __ ] i never thought in my life i'd have to ever justify something like this but i do remember back in 2017 now invited me and a bunch of other people to drink with him and i remember telling now very last minute that i couldn't come so i pretty much flaked on him to say something sexual was gonna happen in a very public event with a load of people even people now didn't even know and wasn't really close with it's just false seriously there's just no question about that i really don't understand how you can reach the conclusion that i invited him just to have sex with him i invited him casually no plane ticket was purchased no specific handmade invite was sent it was flippant nonchalant and that exact same invite was copied and pasted word for word to dozens of people ivory himself even said he did not get any sexual tones from this when he invited you is there any kind of indication that uh it was sort of a date um in any way that there would be a wink wink date like a sexual interaction did he give you that idea at all he didn't like if he was i didn't pick up on it i mean yeah we shared some fat fairy art we had some weird fantasy role play but there was no sexual interest there were no nudes exchanged his name his appearance it wasn't important to me i didn't even know what he looked like at this point i mean if he linked me a picture or something i would have forgotten it because it was just that irrelevant to me but i'm going to jump right ahead anyway and invite him to come over just for sex okay now this document it tries really really hard to prove that i knew ivory's age despite the fact that they have nothing concrete pyrocynical never saw any of the tweets of ivory explicitly saying that he was 15 years old on an account paracynical follow and interacted with regularly they then provide a list of ivory stating his age multiple times on twitter so if i'm so sure that i didn't know he was 15 how would i have missed this this is something i said in my original reddit statement he never once disclosed the fact that he was 15 at the time his exchanges commenced he didn't include his age in his bio until he was 16 but i was not on twitter between the 28th of december 2016 until the 29th of june 2017 as i was suspended it would have been a hell of a lot less likely for me to see all but one of these tweets that's been used as evidence in this google doc my reddit post clearly shows that i was suspended from twitter that the time that they were made and that of course leaves the very last one but like what are the chances of you catching one specific tweet when you follow hundreds of people i bought this up in my reddit post as well but it's been deliberately left out as some like [ __ ] attempt at manipulation i find it funny like they're acting like i'm hiding something when ironically that's exactly what they're doing here literally all they needed to do was read my reddit post it's not even that long man it's a page the next two points the doc makes are so interchangeable i'm just going to tackle both at once pyrocynical never saw the initial dm from ivory saying he was a minor pyrocynical never saw the dm where ivory sent him his twitter profile clearly stating his age the next part really confuses me because now the claim is because he linked his twitter which had his age in his bio i now retroactively know that when this message or that message was sent i knew he was 15. what when ivory linked me his twitter profile the agent bio says 16. this is something i acknowledged in my reddit post but to be fair i probably didn't elaborate enough on it in retrospect i never should have continued the furry stuff with him once i learned of his age even though at the time i didn't see it as a problem legally age of consent is 16 in both my country and his state i didn't consider the age gap significant enough because what we were talking about and doing was so far removed from actual sex it literally was just fantasy furry garbage because i didn't consider ivory sexual in any way in person i never had a plan to progress our friendship into something more and i never considered it an issue i understand though that you know this is going to be one of those weird grey areas where people are going to agree or disagree i think it's a combination of all of these variables coming together which led me to believe at the time there was nothing wrong from a moral standpoint as for the other message i don't remember seeing this message and i'm not sure why it's being used as proof that i knew he was 15 because if you compare the dates this message was sent two months after he sent me his link with his agent bio the last two points for this segment i want to tackle both at once here as well paracynical who at the time was expressing interest in ivory and being in a relationship with him at the time which was corroborated by paracynicals at the time soon-to-be girlfriend still never knew ivory's age an age with eda clearly acknowledged and an age which she thought would not dissuade him from being in a relationship with ivory somehow ivory never mentioned his age and no one else mentioned his age in the presence of paracynical outside of all these clear instances even once so here they're trying to make it seem impossible i wouldn't have known his age or had to do some kind of like insane mental gymnastics to never find out but if you look at the dms ivory provided himself for this document you can see that he's confiding with either about age being a problem keep in mind as well i was not in a relationship with eda until about mid-2019 this document claims it as soon to be but like it's a whole two years before we actually start dating and two whole years before this conversation took place i mean we both talked before but we weren't close she had no reason to confide with me with someone else's private information so back when ivory opened up to ida about something private there is no guarantee that she would have came and told me despite the fact that this document and videos based off this document claim it as concrete irrefutable proof this right here tells me that the conversation is real thus proving that pyro didn't know of ida's age but the conversation was between ida and ivory so you know ida may have not told pyro yeah that claims flat out [ __ ] i mean at this point you're implying that ida has some sort of secret vendetta to take down pyro and purposefully withdrew this information in order to bring him down kinda [ __ ] ridiculous don't you think why would eda think to tell me about a random conversation that she had with someone over two years ago the messages from ivory regarding a relationship were completely one-sided if it helps for context because we're being so open here i'm straight irl like i have no interest in guys this is just purely like a weird fantasy and it does not carry over into the real world whatsoever but one thing there is no excuse about is either attacking ivory and dms once he posted about me what she said is deplorable and i don't agree with it at all it did come from an emotional place but that is not an excuse now one way the document tries to criticize my initial statement is the fact that i used evidence that was later retracted one of them was a twitter thread of someone trying to prove that i was innocent and someone else is an individual that ivory had sent king's stuff to the thing is though with this information retracted my original statement isn't debunked the document fixates on this specific fact that people withdrew information while ignoring so many points like what i mentioned earlier on top of that as well the person who made the threat defending me recently came out and said at no point did he actually apologize for making that thread and his words have been twisted and put in this document to be used against him the reason why i use these twitter screenshots against him is the fact that i felt his accusations came from a place of dishonesty we spoke casually on and off until september of this year i provided screenshots of our conversations that were posted in my reddit statement there was no bad blood and then when other people came out on twitter saying that they also had dishonest experiences with him i used that to further my own belief that these accusations were made for the sake of it me including the anecdotal evidence led to the belief that ivory lied about his age that is never a claim i have made that he has done to me i've only said that i did not know his age at 15. which in turn has caused more people to believe that i lied in my original statement i just want to say though this is not an excuse it is entirely my responsibility to verify age but this never escalated from two morons talking about inhaling fairy farts and i never intended it to ergo grooming there's a message that was used of me basically having a breakdown that was put in ivory's original post saying pretty much how everyone's gonna find out and have to keep looking over my shoulder like my paranoia was through the roof and this has been twisted of course to make it seem that i am guilty for grooming a 15 year old i think it's quite obvious what like i'm actually worried about i didn't want the public to find out that i was a complete degenerate and into this like furry role play [ __ ] and anyone would be embarrassed by that i haven't had any conversations remotely resembling this for the past three years but of course i still did and still kind of do hate myself for it that being said over the last couple weeks i've learned to embrace it because that's all i can do now now this is a good time actually to discuss a discord conversation that was leaked where i'm asking someone for a way to like mass delete discord messages very obvious explanation i was [ __ ] scared of the public finding out that i was a complete degenerate and you know pretty much just being king shamed for all eternity but this has now been twisted into like me trying to hide evidence of grooming to escape internet justice they're trying to make it out to be far more insidious than it actually is and it it's sick people seem to be choosing like what part of my statement to run with instead of acknowledging all of it they twist what they want to twist misinterpret what they want to misinterpret and then they just ignore the rest i'm just again amazed how people read this document and just believed it at face value the problem is i have with this drama that there is no middle ground originally ivory was labeled as a manipulative cloud chaser that could do no wrong because people chose to believe my screenshots over his and you turned out to be what a lot of people were calling you from the start a cloud chaser trying to ruin someone's career on youtube let alone on the internet for attention but now those same people are saying i'm guilty because they read this document and didn't bother to cross-reference it with my original statement not only is there proof of pyro knowing that ivory was underage but definitive proof that the messages were real along with other damning evidence too and also these are the same people that say i shouldn't take my time with this response it's gone too far and too much has come out for him to take his time with it like he did with his last response there needs to be a middle ground i did [ __ ] up there is no excuse and i am sorry for that but i am not a groomer or a predator and documents like these only try to show one side and build a narrative that i'm a liar when i have never actually changed my story from my original post my mistake if anything was not being clearer i have never tried to hide anything this document has managed to fool so many people like you've got this person that came to my meet and greets and they're dressed up as my character the effort they went to was insane but thanks to this document they've recently came out claiming that i was only nice to them because i had an ulterior motive the document also tackles a tweet ivory made where he says he hates me and i'm a leech this was a copy pasta and it was like so easy to disprove the majority of people found out as soon as you like copy pasted the actual tweet into the search bar i didn't even think to mention this in my original statement because it was totally beside the point i think it was included here as a way to make ivory's claims seem more genuine without having to do any actual work why would you try so hard to debunk a claim 20 people complained about on twitter but yet ignore the fact that i provided exact dates of my twitter suspension another argument pyrocynical made lies in the idea that ivory messages other people of similar age around the same time they then show a screenshot that i posted of ivory talking about the cringer fairy stuff with someone else ivory then posted the rest of the conversation on twitter and it really doesn't change the narrative much apart from adding that he wants to be left alone at the time i felt it was more than fair that i show an example of ivory having a similar conversation with someone else and how he wasn't affected by it as he claims he was with me he still excused the guy there was no call out post on him and i think it was fair to question that like why didn't he see a problem now i understand i have a lot more reach and power a much larger platform but this document goes as far as to compare me to legitimate predators like kiwis someone who sent and received nudes to a 14 year old girl lied about it ever happening and then his excuse was don't trust girls people [ __ ] up like teenagers teenagers are stupid man and i'm [ __ ] i [ __ ] up being you know it was really irresponsible i shouldn't have trusted this girl i shouldn't have they also post a screenshot of eda saying that i did this with everyone there's this one part of the doc that claims that people make the mistake of not watching an entire video before they pass judgment and this is like bitterly ironic you make that claim but you leave so much out of my original statement it's written with like such cruel intentions and it waits until page 16 out of 19 only then to confirm that i never actually sent or receive nudes i like as well how they just hit it in the middle of that huge paragraph it also tries to twist conversations like this one you know like claiming that this isn't part of the role play but discussing the hypothetical of having sex with ivory no context no conversation before no conversation after you're just meant to interpret this as a hundred percent i wanted to have sex with him in person this document probably never thought i'd actually respond to it piece by piece because you know the majority of the messages they're so [ __ ] bad to look at this document is cowardly i mean like the ending is no exception like they don't even definitively stay if i groomed anyone they just leave enough room for people to draw that conclusion themself without openly saying it even if this was made in good faith it is a severe case of tunnel vision trying to write or perceive wrong but i can't just sit here you know and let my name get dragged through the mud on a side note unrelated to this duck i've actually seen screenshots circulating around of someone who drew like fan art of my [ __ ] character back in 2016. i then apparently replied to them like jokingly saying not thick enough and then asking for their age and they said 15. so when people saw this they instantly drew parallels to the grooming allegation i asked them for a thick version and they drew this which isn't even really that different from previous things they drew before even getting into contact with me i didn't commission it what was drawn wasn't pornographic they'd drawn very similar stuff before and there was no role play here it was nothing and the thing is this wasn't even a call out post the person that made the original video just that it was funny so i'm gonna address the pyrocynical video now this was in 2015 when this happened i made that video over a year ago it was not meant to be taken seriously at all i'm also wearing the same outfit it was just a funny story from high school to be completely honest that's the only thing that i meant by it i didn't mean it to be a call out post the video was not meant to be taken seriously that being said it was incredibly irresponsible of me and not my best look i admit but this isn't at all comparable to the current situation now i do want to directly say something to ivory and apologize to him and to anyone else that i did the furry role play garbage with what seemed consensual and reciprocal may very well not have been it's not my place to decide it happened it was my responsibility to verify age and i never did and i am sorry for that you shouldn't have been put in that situation and it was stupid of me to message people about this furry stuff without taking into account the influence of my platform especially considering how sexual the tone of these messages were it wasn't until later where i decided this was an issue and decided to stop entirely i hope you can understand the frustration in my original post but i shouldn't have attacked you only apologize and defended myself now really good closing note here for anyone that is still confused to any degree if your accusation is solely paracynical is a complete degenerate and should have not had these conversations with someone that he didn't realize was 15. you win i can't dispute that but if you've either insinuated contributed or directly called me a pedophile who groomed someone knowing that they were 15 that is a completely false claim i've said my piece i've admitted fault and apologized to the best of my ability i just want to move on from this i want it to end thank you for watching and hopefully this gives you a more widened view on the situation,On,Repost

finally by myself which i know doesn't sound that crazy to be by yourself at 1 45 in the morning but um this week's been pretty hectic and there have been a lot of people um a lot of people around telling me what to do giving me advice trying to help me most importantly and and that was a lot and and and now i i just want to i want to be able to do this and just shoot straight into the camera and just talk to you guys um i've put myself in a lot of situations where i needed to apologize for my past actions and i've never done this correctly and i've never done this respectfully and my last video is a testament to that i i don't want to defend that video i don't want to delete that video i just want to be clear what this video isn't going to be is it's not going to be me discrediting trisha kat or any other woman involved i'm going to be using words that may trigger some survivors and that's just so i don't explain anything vaguely and i can explain every situation appropriately i want to start this video off by saying i fully believe the woman who came out against dom and said she was sitting by him as it was reported the next day i got consent to post the video even though i got the consent to post that video i should have never posted it and i what i understand now and i didn't understand before is that she sent that text because she felt like she had to not because she wanted to and that's up and i'm sorry when she later reached out a couple months later to take the video down i immediately took it down and i want to apologize to her and her friends forever putting them in an environment that i enabled that made them feel like their safety and values were compromised i'm so sorry i was completely disconnected from the fact that when people were invited to film videos with us especially videos that relied on shock for views or whatever it was that i was creating an unfair power dynamic i did not know this before it was completely wrong and i wish i was more responsible and i wish i was more aware at the time and i'm so sorry i missed that i didn't know what was going on in that room and i should have been i should have been there and i should have been making sure that everybody involved was was taken care of and wasn't uncomfortable i don't want to use buzzwords to try to justify this or explain this but all i can say is people felt like they had to be silent for the sake of my video and that's not right and it's up and i'm sorry i also want to acknowledge the women that spoke out against dime in 2018 i'm talking about ally and then i'm talking about other girls that address their problems privately or publicly i'm sorry i didn't listen to you guys i am sorry that i that i took dom's word um for what happened those in those certain situations and i didn't believe you and not only did i not believe you but i made a joke of of what kind of a person dom was because i couldn't wrap my head around a childhood friend of mine doing this to people and actually hurting people and and i'm sorry for that not only did i discredit you at me but i platformed dom and not only did i platform down but i platformed the subject of sex in a negative way where i made jokes about it and i reinforced that kind of behavior and i'm so sorry and i really let not only you down but a lot of people down a lot of people that watch me and my friends and family for that i made the decision to no longer film with dom in 2019 and i'm not saying my content has been brilliant since then but that's when i first started taking into account the power dynamic and what influence i had on people that i was filming with but what i didn't do is i didn't go back to any of these women and apologize i i kind of moved on and i learned from it and i grew from it but i didn't address the situation with these women i'm not talking publicly i'm saying even privately i didn't reach out to any of these people and that breaks my heart knowing that that i was doing all this stuff and i was making all this content wow there was people that were still really hurt by what i made before my content shifted to be more responsible and positive i said and did things that were really offensive and i called them bad jokes and i i can't even call them bad jokes and it was cowardly of me to say in my last apology that i missed the mark um because it's gross and i'm sorry a lot of people reached out to me saying cancer culture is and you need to fight back and you need to call people out and i don't agree with how this should be taken at all and i think when there is a crisis there's a serious opportunity to correct yourself to learn and improve and to make sure those mistakes don't happen again and that's what is so important to hold yourself accountable and i think with this situation there's a lot i can look at and there's a lot i can learn from but there's a lot of mistakes that i made and i'm sorry for that i'm sorry for everybody i've let down i'm sorry to my family and i'm sorry to my friends that i'm embarrassed and that this won't happen again i might take a short break from all the social media stuff because i realize there's a serious lack of infrastructure when i make any kind of content and i want to be able to have a place of checks and balances i want to have hr and i want to be able um to have people communicate discomfort in a way that's that's comfortable to them and where they don't feel like their emotions or what they're doing or or how they're acting is compromised it doesn't feel right to go back to posting like i have been and it also doesn't feel right to go dark because i love what i do but i think it is important to show that change is possible and that i'm learning maybe even forgiveness is possible i want to use this opportunity to step up and on my mistakes and like i said before i've never done apology the right way um and i'm sure i'm gonna look back at this and i'm i'm gonna be pissed at some things that i didn't say or i wish i could have added more um but this is this is my beginning to that and and i'm sorry for everybody that i hurt i also want to add that i'm making myself available to anyone that wants to reach out that i've hurt in the past i want to be able to to hear and understand from yourselves and i'll be reaching out on my own to some people because i still have a lot of learning to do and i think when you talk to other people especially about experiences like this it um it really helps you see things in a different way but yeah i'm sorry if this video was all over the place i just wanted to sit and talk and ramble and and i really truly hope that someone can take something away from this experience that another creator can can take away from this and i know it's it feels and because i know how crazy it felt to me that there was some sort of toxicity or some sort of power dynamic in my friend group but really just take the moment especially when creating content that you're trying to get viewership out of or you're trying to get laughs out of like really take a moment and and look at where the jokes end and where the feelings begin because i think that's so incredibly important okay i'll see you guys bye,On,Original
39,Will Smith,YouTube,"Jul 29, 2022",It's been a minute...,https://youtu.be/jXrxDKwlA_s?list=PLqkz-pvmNGHOl3Kw_quVf3v9PyNH4cTJL,I was fogged out by that point. It's all fuzzy. I've reached out to Chris and the message that came back is that he's not ready to talk. And when he is he will reach out. So I will say to you Chris I apologize to you. My behavior was unacceptable and I'm here whenever you're ready to talk. I want to apologize to Chris's mother. I saw an interview that Chris's mother did and you know that was one of the things about that moment I just didn't realize and you know I wasn't thinking but how many people got hurt in that moment. So I want to apologize to Chris's mother. I want to apologize to Chris's family. Specifically Tony Rock. You know we had a great relationship. You know Tony Rock was my man. And this is probably irreparable. I spent the last three months replaying and understanding the nuances and and the complexities of what happened in that moment. And I'm not going to try to unpack all of that right now. But I can say to all of you there is no part of me that thinks that was the right way to behave in that moment. There's no part of me that thinks that's the optimal way to handle a feeling of disrespect or insults. No. It's like you know I made a choice on my own from my own experiences from my history with Chris. Jada had nothing to do with it. I'm sorry babe. I wanna say sorry to my kids and my family for the heat that I brought on all of us. To all my fellow nominees you know this is a community It's like I won because you voted for me. And it really breaks my heart to have stolen and tarnished your moment. I can still see Questlove's eyes. You know it happened on Questlove's award. And you know it's like I'm sorry really isn't sufficient. So there's two things. One disappointing people is my central trauma. I hate when I let people down. So it it hurts it hurts me psychologically and emotionally to know I didn't live up to people's image and impression of me. And the work I'm trying to do is I am deeply remorseful and I'm trying to be remorseful without being ashamed of myself. Right? I'm human. And I made a mistake and I'm trying not to think of myself as a piece of s***. So I would say to those people I know it was confusing I know it was shocking. But I promise you I am deeply devoted and committed to putting light and love and joy into the world. And you know if you hang on I promise we'll be able to be friends again.,On,Original
40,Liver King,YouTube,"Dec 2, 2022",Liver King Confession... I Lied.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_Vd7i4ZpgA,primals I'm making this video to apologize because I [ __ ] up because I'm embarrassed and ashamed because I lied and I misled a lot of people I've stated that this is a complicated as [ __ ] Topic at least to me it is because before social media I was rich and Anonymous and after social media I'm still rich but no longer Anonymous and I never expected this kind of exposure in the public eye it's been tricky as [ __ ] to navigate well clearly I did it wrong and I'm here now to set the record straight yes I've done steroids and yes I am on steroids monitored and managed by trained hormone clinician liver King the public figure was an experiment to spread the message to bring awareness to the 4 000 people a day who kill themselves the 80 000 people a day that try to kill themselves our people are hurting at record rates with depression autoimmune anxiety infertility low ambition in life our young men are hurting them both feeling lost weak and submissive so I made it my job to model teach and preach a simple elegant solution called ancestral living then nine ancestral tenants so our people no longer have to suffer so we can collectively express our highest and most dominant form this is my fight this is why I exist while spreading the message I've been on several podcasts and when asked if I've ever taken steroids I've always said no I don't touch this stuff not going to touch the stuff never touch the stuff that was a lie I've convinced myself that this had nothing to do with the ancestral message I convinced myself that I'm not a competitive athlete of any kind so who the [ __ ] am I cheating I convinced myself that this topic was a placeholder for a far more important conversation I convinced myself that this would overshadow that 36 years of working out usually twice a day without Peds I've convinced myself that this was the vocal minority usually in the fitness category driving to an unproductive conversation and I had convinced myself that this would be the wrong message to send to the 15 year old boys so I continually dismissed it and I dug myself into a bigger and deeper hole I have only myself to blame I did that and it was all wrong I will be better I will talk about it openly because I believe that there's a time and a place for pharmacological intervention monitored and managed by a trained hormone physician in 2021 when I was 43 years old I didn't feel 100 physically or cognitively so I went to get monitored and managed by a trained hormone clinician to see what the [ __ ] was going on with my life and so yes it's true I have tried several peptide combinations in an effort to increase my growth hormone and it didn't work meaning that my levels still remained below the normal level so yes it's also true that I've tried pharmaceutical grade growth hormone and I finally found success in managing therapeutic levels in the normal range yes this is true I've continued on with .6 cc's of testosterone per week roughly 120 milligrams of testosterone a week and no don't take any other steroids like dandrillone or Winstrol but I have tried them in the past without so yes it's also true that my blood chemistry got all [ __ ] up while taking angelone and went strong my lipids got all deranged my liver enzymes went Sky High which is why clinical oversight is an absolute must nope the liver King brand has had nothing or at least very little to do with my business success my companies were already kicking ass already successful before the liver King public figure growing at 50 year over year and still growing at the same Pace after the liver King public figure foreign nope I've never had AB implants AB etching or any other plastic surgery and I sure as [ __ ] never actually had Gene editing done in Singapore I made all of that up it was all intended to be a joke and that's an expression of ancestral 10 and 10 have a little goddamn fun ultimately why did I or why do I do them when I talk about the 85 percent of the population that suffers from self-esteem issues that's me I'm part of that statistic this is why I [ __ ] work myself to death in the gym this is why I do 12 to 15 blood burning workouts a week just to feel like I'm okay still I have to absolutely Crush myself to do so and I'm wrecked physically and cognitively and hormone replacement has helped in a profound and significant way and still I believe that the path to Paradise is paved in [ __ ] hell I previously have said in a weird way I'm grateful for the recent events that have shed light on this complicated as [ __ ] topic I knew I needed to take this opportunity to openly discuss everything for me to be a better human if there are any questions that remain unanswered send them my way I fully own that I [ __ ] up I am as sorry as a man can be and all I can do is take extreme ownership right now be better and Lead myself to a better life as a better human again thank you

41,iDubbbzTV,YouTube,"May 19, 2023","""I miss the old idubbbz"" - YouTube",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRkCfOuW_u0&list=PLqkz-pvmNGHOl3Kw_quVf3v9PyNH4cTJL&index=36,for a while I felt like if I changed my content over time that people would see that as a reflection of who I am and what I value but I I'm starting to realize that that is a very weak and passive way to you know run my channel and live my life so I I think it's you know if I'm gonna have the balls to go to Tana's fan meet up and say slurs at her and then make a video about how it's okay to say slurs I think I should have the balls to make an apology video and take accountability for the mistakes I've made so that's what this video is I've realized that I need to be crystal clear about what I believe so there's no room for ambiguity I am responsible for creating a lot of hurtful and damaging content on this channel and I've also created a culture of uh apathy and I don't know a lot of like cruelty as well like you know some of the videos I've made have been very not edgy I don't think they they you know some of these videos were edgy I think they were just outright cruel so I don't want people to you know get it confused about you know where I stand I have made some cruel hurtful content and I need to acknowledge that and I'm really sorry that it's taken me this long to acknowledge it the content I'm talking about specifically are content cop videos and videos where I was just generally criticizing people for very lackluster reasons and uh you know obviously didn't have any accountability online whatsoever on my end I was morally grandstanding and acting as if I am any better than any of these people that I was making content cop videos on and I'm not I'm a human I'm a real human who makes mistakes and you know I make a different set of mistakes than the people I was making videos on but it doesn't matter I don't think anyone deserves that level of Cruelty or hate it's also indoctrinated a lot of people into thinking that this is an okay way to behave and it's not it's it's super irresponsible and shitty I am very insecure about my ability to create interesting content or like entertain uh it's gotten better over the years but it's something that I have struggled with constantly and it's one of the reasons why I you know kept making this hurtful content you know I I ended up pivoting it into other things because I you know I felt bad about it like innately um but it's still something that I struggle with and I don't want you to interpret that as an excuse but I hope that that is relatable to other creators who maybe struggle with the same thing uh I'm not confident in my ability to entertain and I think if I had to rely on my personality uh to entertain people that I I wouldn't I wouldn't have any amount of success and that is uh really hard to come to terms with I was being very bigoted in a Being bigoted lot of my videos and I Justified it because you know I didn't think it was too serious and I thought that people were going to see that I had good intentions you know but that's so silly you know casual racism is still racism casual bigotry is still bigotry and you know I said a lot of things that uh I I look back at and I cringe now and I'm like that is an awful thing to say it doesn't matter what my intentions are like if I'm hurting people I'm hurting people and you know who the [ __ ] knows what my intentions are like I sarcasm and like uh jokiness and jokey tone only goes so far especially over the Internet even in real life that's like an impossible thing to know with 100 certainty I've just always had this dumb philosophy that I'm not responsible for you know my audience and uh how they behave beyond what content I put out and that's stupid and it's it's led to a lot of hate and a lot of bad outcomes and uh I just want to make it clear that I am absolutely responsible for my audience and uh you know I guess if you want to you know look out for people who are red flags it's definitely people who had my mentality that say I'm not responsible for what my audience does I know that this apology isn't enough I I've clearly done a lot of damage you know these videos have been up for a long time and and have accumulated millions of views I shouldn't be able to just make an apology video and walk away from it this is something that I should live the rest of my life with and I expect to I've profited off of this bigoted content for years and I've made a successful career out of it and that's not right I think that this is only a step in the right direction and I know that a lot more needs to be done to even approach um a life that I would think would be like uh acceptable I am running ads on this video and any revenue generated from this video I'm going to match and donate to an organization that you know would have been particularly affected by the type of rhetoric that I've been spewing on this channel and again this isn't the end of what I'm doing this is just the start I don't feel like a lot of this I dont feel like it represents me anymore content represents me as a person uh at least not anymore there was a time where it probably perfectly represented me because I was a nasty apathetic insecure person now now that I don't feel like it represents me and I want to distance myself from it and keep it from you know indoctrinating more people I'd like to unlist the videos so that people you know can access them still for whatever you know purposes they might want to do that for um but it's not being proliferated on the website I I feel like that that's the best solution at least for the time being and for anyone who liked those videos I you know I want this video to be an example and a lesson for you you know you can like content but you can also think that it's irresponsible and it's hurting other people so just tap into that part of your brain that's saying like oh okay it's like it's probably not that important that this video stays online because truthfully I've seen it I've experienced the content but it's done a lot of damage we we can just let it we can let it go I'm Im sorry sorry to everyone that I made content cop videos on I I still don't like the majority of you and that's fine but I can recognize that you did not deserve the hate and harassment that I sent your way I particularly want to apologize to Tana Tana I'm sorry I shouldn't have never made that video I harassed Hannah in person and then harassed her online and that's deplorable Behavior it's so stupid I'm also sorry to all the black viewers and minority groups who had to put up with that video and put up with you know the phrases I I said either it's all okay or none of it's okay and that's just so dangerous and stupid I have made content that I am proud of over the years it hasn't been as consistent as maybe I'd like it to have been but you know there is a lot of content that I think had a net positive on the world and you know I'm gonna strive to continue on that Trend uh but again I'm not I'm I'm absolutely going to continue to make mistakes but I want the mistakes to be a lot smaller and a lot less serious I Postfight speech also want to give some clarity to the post-fight speech that I gave I mean it wasn't a speech it was a phrase I was like you know I'm not I know not everyone's cup of tea but I I really do uh appreciate the support and um uh you know thank you for coming that was addressing the people over the years that I neglected and I left behind you know the people whose feelings I you know didn't take into consideration those are the people who I was addressing as I know I'm not everyone's cup of tea anyone who thinks that I should be shouting the n-word from the rooftops I don't want to be your cup of tea now I want to talk about events and situations that have happened over the past five years of my life that have led me to the place I'm at now one year I was at a convention and a bunch of fans were you know wanting pictures and this particular fan came up to me and said I know you probably don't like transgender people but can I you know get a picture that smacked me in the face I was like oh holy [ __ ] why would you think that but I mean it was fairly obvious I was being cruel hateful bigoted and uh being very uncaring about people's feelings that is a very fair assessment to make I was giving this person bad vibes and I think I've given a lot of people extremely bad vibes another event that was very important for me to experience was I went on a boxing podcast I was basically like trying to walk back my Tana content comp you know I was still very like insecure and uncomfortable with the fact that I made that video and uh but I was still coping you'll see me struggle in this clip to you know say that it was wrong so I just wanted to uh Why I made the video let you talk on that right because obviously uh using the n-word is definitely frowned upon by a lot of people especially by a non-african-american but I was just curious that was a very weird video because I wanted to like criticize her for her like sort of flagrant use of it I've been pretty flagrant about it too not in the same way um and uh I thought there was a message to be to be shared there and um I don't think it was particularly it was okay in criticizing her but I think it like I probably wasn't the person to deliver the message if that makes sense there was a message that I was trying to put out there and like I'm not really the person to put out that message I don't regret making the video I think you know there's there's uh bits and pieces to take from it that I think are valuable uh but you know I probably wouldn't make it these days I'm very Im stupid grateful to those guys and how they uh broach the subject because you know it didn't put me on the defensive it just made me realize like I'm stupid I'm stupid and I really need to like acknowledge these things like like what am I doing I'm still trying to make excuses for myself and like you know why I made that video it's like it was a dumb idea I harassed someone I was saying slurs and I was trying to justify it all a very big thing that has sort of altered my view on all of this is just the amount of hate and harassment my wife Anisa has received over the years uh she's had to deal with it from the beginning of our relationship and I have done a horrible job at acknowledging her and her feelings for it I a lot of the time I just thought that that was that was her problem or that was um you know other people's problem like it's not my problem that you're getting hate and harassment and it's like no it absolutely is you know that's the culture that I cultivated and I you know didn't do anything to change that you know over the years it's changed a little bit but you know I don't think I've still fully acknowledged how how responsible I am for the amount of harassment that Anissa has had to deal Openness with and this year I decided to speak more candidly and and be more open about who I am as a person and to speak on my life a little bit more and I did that on Anthony Padilla's podcast these are the people that I'm attracting these are the people that I'm entertaining like I need to reevaluate things they are relating and enjoying this content for a reason and that's not maybe the same reason that I'm trying to make I had a very wild west mentality when it came to online Behavior like people are going to do what they want to do you're going to say what they want to say and I can pretty much do the same because it's the internet but I think you have to be a lot more responsible if you guys are at all interested in how I've arrived here that video gives you know a good bit of context and talks about some of my life a little bit there is a clip from this interview that's been floating around the internet and it's me calling my fans anti-social and basement dwellers and I was like I didn't like you know interacting with my fans I just want to be clear like I that was my realization I think a lot of people are like of course that happened is because you were creating that culture and you were attracting those people and it's like yes I know I know now I didn't know before it was my realization upon you know meeting more and more fans that I was like oh [ __ ] you guys are are struggling it was easy for me to identify them struggling when they were outside of my body but the anti-social basement dwelling in cell that was inside here I I couldn't acknowledge that I couldn't recognize that so I needed the mirror to be held up to me in closing I want to say that I have always thought that I was an empathetic person because I thought well I get angry I get sad of course I got empathy seems easy right empathy I definitely have that there were moments where like a dog would die in a in a film and I'd cry so it's like of course I have empathy but I never did uh I think only in these past couple of years have I gained the ability empathy and I'm very ashamed to admit that it sounds it sounds really pathetic to say at the age of 32 I've acquired empathy but I have and I've realized it because I just like can't help myself but uh like feel for other people's pain and Outro suffering now I'm still not perfect I you know I I think that is uh you know my empathy meters only maybe like a quarter of the way filled up potentially but it's at least there and I just want you guys to know that you can unlock ability empathy if you you know experience more life it might take you getting hurt a little bit but uh it's worth it it is so worth it so thank you for watching everyone I do want to create more regular content and um you know I don't want to just have the next five videos be apologies so I I have uploaded a squirrel video on my second Channel if you want to watch that I guess there's one final thing I just want to thank everyone who's given me the space and the compassion to grow as a person because it's taken longer than it probably should have I appreciate everyone and I think most importantly I appreciate my wife Anisa she has been insanely uh compassionate and helpful and patient in uh you know allowing me to grow over the years and has has legitimately encouraged me to be a better person and not a better person and just like the you know idubbbz becoming woke kind of way she has she was the one who said that I should try this boxing thing I would have never done that on my own because I was insecure and I was pathetic I did this and I am so glad I did uh it's been amazing so Anisa I love you you're amazing right now you're streaming uh but bon voyage toodles,On,Original
42,JacksFit,TikTok,"Jun 29, 2023",,https://www.tiktok.com/@jacksfit/video/7369600022167424288,Today I want to quickly talk about the last 48 hours. There's two reasons why I accepted the club with a No. 1 obviously. I'm not gonna lie I was confident this club would get views. The second. The second reason is you may not know this about me but I'm a pretty shy guy and over the past few months I've been going to loads of events and doing a lot of collabs to step out my comfort zone. This collab with Ed was just another one of those that got escalated. I've spoken with Jones I've spoken with. I've spoken with James personally and I've apologised for what I've said about him. And I just want to apologise to you guys. Maybe I've not been myself and I just want to get back to my roots at the gym and you know keep the gym content coming. And obviously I still want to do clubs now and again but the gym is gonna be my main focus. Thank you to everyone for supporting me and I'll see you guys back in the gym.,On,Original
43,Colleen Vlogs,YouTube,"Jun 29, 2023",hi.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceKMnyMYIMo,hey it's been a while since you saw my face I haven't been doing so great so I took a little break a lot of people are saying some things about me that aren't quite true doesn't matter if it's true though just as long as it's entertaining you right you guys having fun all aboard the toxic gossip train chugging down the tracks of thisinformation the toxic gosip train you got a oneway KCK manipulation station toxic gossip train tie me to the tracks and harass me for my past cuz rumors look like facts if you don't mind the gaps I won't survive in the crash but hey at least you have fun uh hi everyone I've been wanting to come online and talk to you about a few things um even though my team has strongly advised me to not say what I want to say I recently realized that they never said that I couldn't sing what I want to say so I am and um today I only want to talk about the facts so I hope that you'll be willing to listen here we go many years ago I used to message my fans uh but not in a creepy way like a lot of you are trying to suggest it was more of a loser kind of way where I was just trying to be besties with everybody it's kind of like uh when you go to like a family gathering you know and there's a weird ant there keeps coming up to you and going like hey girl what's the tea and you're like um that was me but in group chats with my fans it was weird I've been sharing my life online for over 15 years I've poured my heart out to you and because of that I feel like I'm talking to my friends but in the beginning of my career I didn't really understand that maybe there should be some boundaries there there were times in the DMS when I would overshare details of my life which was really weird of me I haven't done that for years you see cuz I changed my behavior and I took accountability but that's not very interesting is it so let's go on the toxic gossip train the locomotives fueled with hateful accusations the toxic gossip train steam roll over someone's reputation toxic gossip train hop on board but CL close your eyes otherwise you'll realize that the train is made of lies and that person you despise maybe didn't deserve to die but hey at least you're having fun in all seriousness I do think it's really important to hold people accountable for their mistakes um you know we should hope that everyone can learn from their mistakes and grow and change their behavior and be a better person and this is something that I've always tried to do when I make mistakes and it's something that I will continue to try to do what oh you don't care oh okay I thought you wanted me to take accountability but that's not the point of your mob mentality is it no your goal is to ruin the life of the person you despise while you dramatize your lies and monetize their demise yeah um I feel like I can already hear the comments on this video she's gaslighting manipulating oh she's a narcissist and a rat I would never make a mistake like that oh I'm sorry I didn't realize that all of you are perect so please criticize me bring out the daggers made from your perfect past and stab me repeatedly in my bony little back I'm sure you're disappointed in my shitty little song I know you wanted me to say that I was 100% in the wrong well I'm sorry I'm not going to take that route of admitting to lies and rumors that you made up for clout everybody I found someone new to harass she did some things that I do not like in her past so everybody gather around cuz we're about to attack but not based on facts Oh no you're loaded Le the weapon is your fingers on the keys you don't need any armor when you can hide behind a screen so shoot me down quick with a click and Bam reputations deceased uh I also wanted to take a minute to talk about that girl Miranda Sings you know the one yeah her she PG-13 it says that on my website and it's always been that way and that's why you won't find my videos on the YouTube kids app anyway um I didn't realize it was my responsibility to decide what was appropriate for every kid to see I've always relied on parents to decide if they're comfortable with their families watching my YouTube videos or coming to my live shows now have aaz and jokes and poor taste yes yes have I made lots of dumb mistakes yes am I sad that there are some fans who feel betrayed yes it was my intention to manipulate no it doesn't really matter what my intention was because it seems as though everyone's already decided on that let me tell you it's not very fun to have millions of people all over the world call you the most vile horrendous disgusting life ruining words that a person can be called in my opinion um it doesn't matter that these things aren't true uh everyone just believes that you are the type of person who manipulates and abuses children so I just wanted to say that um the only thing I've ever groomed is my two Persian cats I'm not a gr I'm just a loser who didn't understand I shouldn't respond to fans and I'm not a predator even though a lot of you think so because 5 years ago I made a fart joke so even though I know this video won't change anyone's mind about me I still felt it was important to to come on here and defend myself a little and take accountability and I also wanted to say that to anyone out there who has ever supported me in any capacity I really really appreciate you thank you for what it's forth I never had any bad intentions but I do feel like [ __ ] the toxic gossip train

44,LinusTechTips,YouTube,"Aug 16, 2023",What do we do now?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cTpTMl8kFY&t=2s,I think Luke put it best at the roast a few years ago when he said Why the f**k are you here? That's a two-part answer. I'm speaking today because of the recent community outcry demanding change. I'm here because I agree with the community. We do have a lot of work to do. Before we talk about that while I wish this on better terms I just want to say I'm very glad to meet you all. I have spent the last couple of decades on the corporate side but my educational background is in computer science. My first role in the tech industry was as the writer at NeoSeeker. My history building gaming PCs was even further back to when I built I'd sell around 300 ARig because everyone assured me it was guaranteed to overclock to 450 MHz. I guess my trip didn't really get the memo. In any case it feels really good to be back on most days. I'm only six weeks into the job but in that time I've seen a lot. I've looked at some budgeting some team building and operations. But my main focus has been to be a fly on the wall and gain an understanding of what's going right and what's going wrong. There's a lot of both. I've asked the team to unflinchingly address both the concerns that have been raised Yvonne lays out the plan for content reduction and how we intend to fix them with the money we'll make from our sponsor. Just kidding. I was asked for unflinching and here it is. Linus is a human gas molecule. You've been telling him for years and I've been telling him for years. Staying relevant on YouTube is hard for everyone. But we aren't fighting for survival anymore and we don't need to run at this pace. In fact in some ways it's our efforts to keep doing more and keep doing better that have created our current situation. My background is in managing a pharmacy where the small details matter a lot. And basically I agree with the community so I'm putting my foot down. Effective immediately all YouTube video production is on pause. And our teams are going to be spending this entire next week focusing on long-term workflow changes to make our content better in a lasting way. This means for the first time in over 12 years LTT will be missing not just one daily upload but many. But improving to the degree that we want and need is going to take more than a week. So I'll be working with Terren and Colton to manage our sponsor commitments and the financial hit of both this housekeeping week and a reduction in our LTT upload schedule. At least for now while we get our house in order. But before anyone gets concerned that we're going to cut investments into the well-being of our personnel and our future capabilities I can assure you that I've read the criticisms that we weren't willing to spend $500 to test a product. And as the one that manages the finance I can tell you that couldn't be further from the truth. Linus made a clear and egregious judgment error regarding retesting a product he felt was impractical. That was wrong and I've told him so. He allowed his personal feelings on the matter to cloud his judgment. And I want to stress that our organization is committed to our ongoing investments in making our content better. And we will do better as a team. Why don't I let our chief money spender take it from here? Hi I'm Gary head of labs. Gary head of labs talks transparency First off we've made some mistakes. Too many. We're hoping that it's how we deal with them moving forward that will define who we are. And regardless it's clear that we need to serve you better. So our team will be spending our week publishing living documents for our testing standards and opening them up to feedback from the community and our peers in the industry should they wish to participate. We will also test part of the team with going back through every video with labs data to ensure accuracy make full corrections and if there are any fundamental issues with the workflow design or results pull or replace that video outright. I don't agree with every criticism that's been leveled at my team. But for my part I need to own what we've done wrong and lay out our action plan for how to move forward. Before I do that one point I do need to address here is that Linus misspoke when he said we retest for every video. We retest for every project. When we use the same data for our RX 7600 and RTX 4060 Ti videos we knew in advance that these cards would release two days apart and designed a broad test suite that accounted for all the numbers we would need to make those two videos and ran everything at once with no bios or driver changes. In fairness Linus the project to video ratio is normally one to one but the devil's in the details. Now let's talk about what's coming. We will release our current mark bench harnesses as open source items so that the community can audit the code around our test integrations. We will do a vlog style video on floatplane about our testing from start to finish so you can see how the sausage is actually made. We will open a new community forum post asking for transparency suggestions and more importantly we will follow up. We will start placing our testing project number in the credits so we are always open about the data set that was used for the benchmark results. And there is a lot more still to come ranging from test variation percentages per workbench to each benchmark we utilized in videos among others. It's going to be a busy week of not making videos. James head of writing on process improvement Same goes for us. I'm James head of the writing department. We are extremely grateful for everything the lab has done and continues to do to make our jobs easier. But the actual testing is not the biggest source of our recent struggles. It's the human factor. There have been times when an internal video review caught an incorrect graph resulting in new versions of the graph being created only for those new graphs to not be put in the video. Just about every error that has appeared in a video in the past year has directly resulted in a process change designed to prevent that specific issue from ever happening again. But this kind of problem pops up create a new process whack-a-mole isn't working. We'll be using our time to take feedback from our team on all of our processes and comb through all of our pending projects for areas where we can improve as we move forward with our reduced upload schedule. You'll see some of these videos go up during our time off. We already have multiple videos that are scheduled for release. But my main message to the team is that we want to spend this time working on inter-department communication and cleaning up our house. What we won't be doing is sanitizing things too much. We know that some of our best videos are centered around Linus and other members of the team goofing around with tech and having fun. That is not going to stop. But others like GPU and CPU releases certainly require all the rigor we can muster. Those launches don't happen as often these days. So it will take some time before you see the full payoff of our continuous improvement. But it has already started happening. Not only did the community love our 4060 review but our team found it less stressful to put out. Have we had a flawless victory? No. But since these last reviews we've onboarded a dedicated visualization person whose full-time job it is to create graphs that are correct digestible and accessible. We've done serious development on our automatic specs database things so that our visualizations pull the correct info in every time. And we'll soon be announcing the details of a new crowdsourced fact-checking system for both LTT and Tech Quickie so that our content's correctness satisfies even our most discerning community members. Ed head of production on communication I'm Ed head of our production team. We have some of the most comprehensive documentation and processes in the company from automations to key project information accurate to communication procedures to standards for how loud videos can be. Those systems have helped with the video edit side of things but I've seen some examples where we've failed to see the forest for the trees and allowed well-edited but erroneous content to slip through the cracks. So for our part we'll be spending our time looking at how we can improve communication to help the team address anything that seems off as soon as possible. A personal task for me will be putting the finishing touches on some cool ways that we can make small edits that avoid the slap-dash text-on-screen corrections whenever possible. As for how we catch those bugs that's not my department Nick from CW on quality control so I'm throwing it over to Nick. Hold on hold on. I'm mostly on the product side lttstore.com. What? Somebody had to say it. But the theme of today's video is transparency and accountability. You might not see me in video credits but I still serve as a last line of defense in reviewing most LTT videos before they are published. I typically check for security links and inappropriate or NSFW jokes but there are times when I catch a factual error or a weird graph that doesn't really tell the full story. To be clear we also have checks for technical aspects from our writing team and in some cases the lab but our processes for ensuring those checks happen and following up these findings haven't been perfect and our corrections are often made quickly. So while we take this time to reflect I'll be focused on helping build a set of guidelines for our pre-release reviews and trying to set up a system that allows our team to take a finer look at every aspect of our videos. Every single time. And maybe with time everyone here will be so aligned with our mission that my input is no longer needed and I can focus my full attention on making little widgets that you don't need but definitely want. Like this retro-themed screwdriver. Terren lays out plans to improve credibility Errors in our supporting assets like tables and graphs chip away our credibility. So continuing to improve our process issues to minimize errors will mean a top priority under my leadership. I guarantee there will be future mistakes. We are human. But in next week we'll be creating and publishing a clear policy for correction handling and I'll be working with the community management team to be prompt and transparent with corrections that are as visible as possible. I think what happened with the Pwnage mouse is a perfect example of the kind of breakdown that should never happen again. Last Friday Linus was notified of the issue a couple hours before the WAN show where he discussed the errors of the video in short circuit and apologized unequivocally. But while we recut the video to remove the misleading information no one closed the loop and dealt with the tone-deaf and frankly unapologetic correction in the pinned comment. Our mission is to get the information in the community which includes having a degree of humility about our mistakes even if it makes us look less than perfect. The other side of my job as CEO is keeping the lights on ensuring our staff is well taken care of and putting dollars into some fun stuff like water cooling a PC with a pool. And that's through sponsorships affiliate programs paid subscriptions or merchandise sales. One thing that's not negotiable with me ownership or the business team on sponsored content is we need to maintain control of the creative. I was on a call with a potential partner recently. They asked for a cream puff piece. What's a cream puff piece? That's when they're like how much money do we have to give you just so that you tell the story that we want? Before I can jump in and say anything just because I'm in shock at this point in time Nick turns over and says no absolutely not. I started laughing a little bit and I just said hey Nick there's probably a better way to handle that where we could just soften up a little bit. But the truth is I don't disagree with him. We've had many rocky periods with sponsors where they're not happy with the content or the conclusions and because they couldn't affect the editorial events. This has and continues to to have significant negative impacts on revenue. I think we're pretty transparent on how where and why we make our money. And one of our strategic pillars is to make sure that we can maintain editorial independence. This has included on multiple occasions saying goodbye and good luck to sponsors ranging from thousands of dollars a year to hundreds of thousands of dollars a year over remaining independent and doing right by the LTT community. While we were deciding if we were a good fit for each other I was very pleased to see the integrity of the team here based on the deals that these guys have walked away from. I think one thing that we've done a poor job of however is publishing these standards where a community can see them. That's something I'll be improving upon. Colton on ethics and sponsorships And so will I. I'm Colton the head of business development which includes departments like HR procurement logistics events and sales and marketing. Sponsorships specifically are an area where Linus has more limited oversight than he used to. And in my opinion we haven't done a great job conveying that. It's up to my team to vet incoming sponsor requests and deal with issues that you our viewers have with our brand partners. One way we do that is using our LMG Sponsor Discussion Subforum on LinusTechTips.com to create a dialogue between our business team and the community. It's obvious from some of the issues we're seeing that we need to be more communicative when we're actively working with brands to rectify issues. Most content creators can attest to the fact that brands sometimes take forever to respond to messages or address problems. A perfect example is Anker not removing LinusTechTips from their Amazon pages even though we've been asking to be removed since our partnership with them ended months ago. We work hard to push for accountability but we also understand that these businesses are either large with lots of moving parts or small with limited resources. So things can take time but you shouldn't be waiting in the dark. It's critical for us to get the sponsorship piece right because real talk you guys are the boss. If you're not happy with brands we work with you won't engage with our sponsors and suddenly we won't be able to support all the cool stuff we're currently able to do. Moving forward then you can expect weekly updates in the sub forum on issues that need addressing and we'll also include an up-to-date list of product verticals that are off limits for our channels. We hope this will enable us to make better calls consistently from here on out all while maintaining our long-time commitment to transparency. Finally I want to apologize to Billet Labs for auctioning off their monoblock at LTX 2023. Our processes failed when I was selecting items to include in the charity auction but then it was compounded because when the issue was brought up to me via email even though I replied two hours later apologizing and offering to pay for the component I forgot to actually include our contact in that email. So it went to our procurement team instead of Billet Labs. Side note that same team God bless them didn't ask our event team who won the silent auction items and proceeded to email everyone asking. We don't need any of that. Certainly not for tax purposes. I clearly need to spend some of my week training the team unless I actually get fired for real this time. Moving forward we'll be implementing a more rigid process for separating items that need to go back and which ones we'll be holding onto for future testing. This might ring a little hollow coming from one half of the WAN show team Luke talks supporting the rest of the team that brought you trust me bro in the privateering incident among others but we need to be better about our communication. Now I have no intention to like kill the silly humor or be less open with people. I don't want anything to be less fun but we do need to be respectful and conscious of the impact of our words. We should be proud of the work that we do but we shouldn't negatively compare ourselves to our fellow tech reviewers. When issuing corrections we need to apologize. We need to respect people's time and their money. I said after the last round of this that you don't win by screaming loudly or drama-ing hard. You win by fixing problems improving and becoming a hard target. We're still f***ing up a lot and we need to own that fix it and move on not be defensive or shirk blame. That being said I'm not really on the production side of things these days. What my teams and I are working hard on is to support the other teams in other ways. Reintegrating into LMG has been somewhat terrifying. One of my team's jobs is to take over management of the infrastructure and while I have brought an experienced team member into the fold it needs a lot of work. So far we've mostly just been focused on documenting what we even have and most of our initial steps beyond that will be improving overall stability rather than flashy video-worthy projects. Any production interruptions due to shoddy infrastructure add additional burden to the other teams and our goal is six nines. We will also continue to maintain and develop our inventory system which with better processes should be able to help keep things like Billet's prototype from being mishandled misplaced and misused in the future. And the foundational work we're doing on reliable data management and storage should enable teams like the editors and the engineering folks in the lab to move faster and more confidently with lower risk of errors thanks to new tools like our specs database. Among my other unmentioned and unrelated responsibilities is keeping Linus from driving off various cliffs which I have failed at a number of times. A wild Linus appears And let's face it he's gonna fail again. Hey it's me. I'm chief vision officer now but realistically I'm not gonna be able to hide behind my recent demotion here. I was the one at the head of the company for each and every mistake that our community has rightly brought to our attention. And once again I made things worse by allowing myself to respond emotionally. It's honestly really hard when people take an internal process error and then they run that all the way to Linus is a thief and wants to auction someone else's intellectual property to the highest bidder or accuses me of trying to brush something under the rug just because I do think it's important to get all the details before declaring me to be a lowdown liar straight up piece of s***. We were slow shipping back the GPU that Billet Labs sent us. There's no way around it. That's our bad. But the delay in communication the one that prompted the post that you guys just saw it was less than two business days. The second that I was made aware of the situation on the 14th I emailed Billet Labs and I explained what happened. I even included Colton's attempt at apologizing and offering no questions asked full compensation for their stated value of the product which happened on the 10th before we were under any pressure to do so and without Colton even bothering to check with me or Yvonne before just saying go for it. He knows that our internal policy is to do the right thing. So he tried bless him. I guess his job is safe for another day. And I I'm sorry I guess I've actually gotten a little bit emotional here again. So I'm going to stop there because whatever's being said about me and whatever's being said about the team should never have allowed my feelings to distract from any valid criticism of our work. My decision for example to not bother retesting the monoblock that was obviously wrong. And my lame response on the forum was a huge and unnecessary blunder. I owe you guys better. And I'm sorry for my part first I'm going to be working through the other members of the exec team for any crisis communication moving forward. And second I'm going to spend my week working with the other teams to develop a system of processes that will help our company fulfill my vision of being a world-class tech media organization. I'm also going to be spending my week just refocusing guys on what matters most which is bringing you guys the best damn content that we can make. It's been over 10 years. Lord it's been almost 15. But I still love tech. I love my team. And even though our relationship's a little rocky right now I love this community and everything that it stands for. None of that has changed and none of it is going to. During my interview one line from Linus that stood out to me was Terren's closing thoughts I need somebody to come in who I know will be respectful of my life's work. That's when the gravity of what he was asking for dawned on me for the first time. I'm by no means an influencer or social media guy. But suddenly I am accountable not only to Linus and Yvonne and the entire staff at LMG but most importantly to the entire LMG audience. I'm fortunate to be inheriting a wonderful team that is passionate and has a ton of energy who shares the same goal. We celebrate our wins together and when we make mistakes we also share the responsibility. I'll be coaching the team on the kinds of deep state corporate stuff that I think I'm reasonably good at. Budgeting team building relationship management business development operational processes. All things I consider to be essential life skills rather than the tactics of some sort of weird Illuminati conspiracy. We need to be a more well-oiled machine with better accountability as we've gotten more complicated internally with how technical writing editing teams all have to coordinate. There are still going to be deadlines due dates and time limit of goals that we still need to drive towards but the how of all this obviously needs more polish. I planned these topics to be covered in internal conversations over the coming weeks but instead I'm talking to you about it during this on-the-job experience of what it's like to work at a YouTube company. For all our awards the team has worked hard to build up trust in the community and share the joy and the passion that we all have for tech so I do not take for granted the responsibility and stewardship that comes along with this position. And I welcome continued constructive feedback. Thank you all for holding us accountable. I feel ready for the challenge and ready for this message from our sponsor. Just kidding. Again. But dbrand did offer.,On,Original

46,Watcher,YouTube,"Apr 23, 2024",An Update,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iFYULNTznI,- Hey everyone. Last Friday we announced that we're leaving YouTube and launching our new streaming platform. - We messed up. Apology A lot of you spoke out with extremely valid comments and concerns and we wanna take the time now to address those. - We've been reading the things you've been saying and we're sorry for the way we handled this as well as the way we communicated it. We understand where you're coming from and we're making immediate changes. - First we wanna affirm that you are the reason why we've been able to do anything at this company. You helped us every step of the way when we left BuzzFeed to start Watcher at the top of the pandemic in 2020. - You've supported us in so many ways by watching our content attending our live shows buying our merch becoming members of our Patreon and giving words of encouragement over the years. And we are incredibly grateful for your support. - We're sorry for how we originally delivered our goodbye message to YouTube. It was insensitive. We didn't properly express how much we appreciate all of you. And we did a really bad job of explaining the reasoning behind this transition. - We also want to deeply apologize for our ignorance around the impact of the cost. Ignorance We regret stating and implying that it's a price that anybody can afford and we fully acknowledge that it is not. We didn't take the proper consideration for how this cost would affect you and hope you know that we are taking this as a serious learning experience. With that in mind we're making some changes to ensure that there's a way for our community to continue watching our content for free. Free - If you wanna watch our shows early and ad-free you can catch them on the Watcher platform a month earlier. After that you'll be able to watch our shows on YouTube for free. For those that have already subscribed to the platform we are so grateful for your support. But if this change has you rethinking your membership we will issue a full refund. And all past episodes and series will remain available on YouTube. - As for the question of why we decided to launch our own platform when we started Watcher in 2020 we wanted to create shows that we were proud of that we had ownership over and that would provide you the caliber of content that we felt you deserved. However we were finding it harder and harder Ownership to stay relevant to advertisers and the constantly changing YouTube landscape. We faced some incredibly challenging decisions. We didn't want to compromise our content to ensure they met advertising requirements. And we definitely did not want to lay people off that have brought Watcher to life behind the scenes. And we didn't want to bring Watcher to a close which would have happened if we stayed solely on YouTube. Platform - That's why we decided to launch the platform so that we as a company could continue we could pay our staff fairly and not only continue to make great content for you but expand with new shows new voices all ad-free. And now with the addition of accessible options this is a decision that we all believe is the best for Watcher. - However we realize that in figuring out the logistics of what this might take we overlook the way it would impact all of you. Patreon We hope you'll be patient with us through these mistakes and we remain incredibly sorry that they were made in the first place. We also want to directly address our Patreon community who have played such a key role in supporting us from the very beginning. All current Patreon members will receive a free subscription code to the platform. If you already purchased a subscription please contact us and we will issue you a full refund. - We Look forward to continuing to make shows and introducing all the incredible things that we've got planned for the platform alongside YouTube. And in the meantime we are forever grateful to all of the people who make up our community. And we hope that you consider joining us in this next chapter of our journey whether that's on YouTube or on the platform. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thanks everybody.,On,Original

I explained that I was sick and wanted to prioritize my health. I stated ""I think it may have been the Chinese pollution that blows over to Korea"". I have since received a lot of messages from the Chinese community regarding this. I’d like to apologize for my comment and how that could hurt people’s feelings. It was an extremely unnecessary comment and I can see how it can come off as disrespectful and distasteful. In no way was I trying paint China in a bad light. Again I apologize to anyone this affected and will make sure that going forward I am more mindful with what I say on stream.",On,Original
48,The Gabbie Show,YouTube,"Sep 11, 2024",A Long Overdue Apology,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svKhRBAkqY,today is September 10th 2024 which means exactly 10 years ago today a decade ago today I posted my very first YouTube video it was a Q&A um nothing special except my hair my hair was absolutely positively Majestic but naturally uh when you come across like a big milestone like a 10year anniversary it makes one reflect so I've been reflecting and as I've reflected on the past 10 years of my life my career at large I feel like I owe a lot of people apologies so I wrote some notes I have a list okay so the first bunch of people that I'd like to say thank you and I'm sorry to is anyone I've ever worked with from collaborators producers uh management agents anyone from PA on set to director special I'm sorry goes out to MTV and YouTube and YouTube Originals because I um was difficult to work with I took a lot of opportunities that I didn't deserve and also had no business doing there were a lot of people who kind of you know practiced and trained and wanted some of those opportunities their whole lives and I was able to do them with really little to no actual effort in that space so also sorry to anybody who deserved the opportunity more than me that I took from them based on like social media followers etc etc this apology covers a wide breadth of people so like I said if you've ever worked with me or had an interaction with me at some type of work event and you were unhappy or felt hurt in some way I'm very sorry and thank you for the opportunities that I've been given and uh the patience and Grace that I've been shown that I definitely didn't deserve and the professionalism as well that I definitely didn't deserve and definitely was not displaying so thank you and I'm sorry in that vein I also want to say sorry to anybody who feels like I used them or took advantage of them in any type of collaboration or work setting as well whether you helped me out with a project and didn't get your proper flowers or didn't pay you well or at all a lot of times there was just like a collaboration basis and I feel like I could have done better with hyping up people that I've worked with and showing appreciation by sharing influence with people who have helped me out literally reading my notes I was self fish only cared about how I could benefit thank you and I'm sorry I got my lick back um I also want to say thank you and I'm sorry to all of my friends past present who I just H I dumped so much negativity on I was such a dark cloud and was constantly just in something that I just I know what it's like to be around somebody who's always like in some type of like negative head space so thank you to anybody who's been there for me in those times and I'm sorry for anybody who was affected or brought down by my just complaining my complaining and also in that vain gossip I want to say sorry to anybody who whether I've spoken out of turn behind your back shared information that wasn't mine to share I'm sorry again I got my lick back and this was a big big lesson for me in general um about yeah speaking about somebody when they're not in the room in in a negative way or in a way that uh is overstepping personal boundaries so that's a big one for me I feel like I owe that apology to a lot of people from literally my whole life uh and especially in my entertainment career so um sorry about that I genuinely have learned and grown in that area a lot and am still to this day it's really hard not to oh I also want to say sorry to anybody who was a subject of a storytime video or who I shared a personal experience with or even not a personal experience like anytime anytime I've ever engaged in celebrity gossip or Ed somebody as a punchline um but mainly the story times like when I was sharing these personal experiences online for um entertainment content Factor like yeah one of my ickiest one of my ickiest things I feel like which which blows because it was is also one of my biggest things right this is one of the reasons I deleted like all of my videos I get that comment all the time like why did you delete all your videos and that was mostly it it was just not a representation of myself it was not a representation of Christ it was not a representation of anybody I wanted to be and it was off the backs of gossip and complaining and telling one-sided narratives and making other people feel victimized and bullied whether it's Anonymous or not like I just put people in a situation where they felt embarrassed and hurt and ashamed and again I got my lick back like by scale anybody that I've ever told a story about and shown a negative light on I definitely have felt the weight of that and uh God humbled me and taught me empathy in that area so I'm genuinely wholeheartedly sorry for what I put you through it was probably really really difficult and traumatizing so I feel you and I'm sorry I also want to take this time to say I'm sorry to my family or just in general people at home who feel like I either capitalized on you know shared experiences that shouldn't have been shared so freely or just projecting anything that I was feeling on to you I feel like um I do that in general but I think with my family I've done that a lot there's a lot of things I could say and want to say to my family which I'm sure I will more in person hey guys um and talking about my past I know I'm talking about your past as well so I'm sorry about that and thank you for not being too hard on me about it I'm sorry for not visiting more for my contribution to any wedges or distance in our relationships I'm so grateful to be home I have loved spending the last year or so here and uh I feel really just blessed and grateful to have so many people here right off the bat as soon as I came back and I really appreciate you and I'm looking forward to the years to come now that I am here in Pennsylvania in front of this pile of Vlogs I love you and I also have to give the biggest most like how could I refine the words I need to apologize to all of my fans anybody who ever supported me for so many things uh being inconsistent for worrying you for breaking promises for being a bad role model first and foremost honestly like from the beginning of my career to the end like I'm right now I'm deleting so much content I'm deleting a lot of my music so I know I'll probably get some questions about you know where's the song where's the song uh where are these music videos I took a lot of it down it was either because of profanity subject matter or just like immodesty like I'm embarrassed watching a lot of those videos um I grew a lot I wish I would have taken more advice when I was coming up in the in the field like I remember one of my first writing sessions somebody said to me like you can you can avoid swearing if you can help it and I was like no I want to swear I'm so edgy and ignoring even like people telling me that I should like cover up more and stuff like I wish I would have because now here I am 33 years old um embarrassed and having to delete a lot of work and effort that I you know put into a project but no regrets I learned a lot I learned a lot and everything is just tuition at God University time spent at God University Lessons Learned but I'm so sorry for all of the Just poor Behavior Reckless Behavior um self-centered vain prideful just meaningless content and yeah I'm going to do everything I can to counteract that um I have a sort of constant battle like literally always of like can I disappear into nothing and just like exist you know in the woods and knowing that I've been given a great responsibility that I already fumbled and misused and needing to use that responsibility uh more wisely so yeah I've been like a really I've been a really poor example and I've been really ungrateful to you I also want to say a special I'm sorry to any of my patrons on patreon um just so inconsistent like yeah I I got to do better I know I've been saying that for so long which is the problem like it's I'm trying so hard I really really am and I know apologies have to come with action I really am trying like I'm trying like I need I need help like something to make it so that I can be consistent because um I just I don't have the greatest executive functioning in fact I have impaired executive functioning and I'm trying to figure out how to do it it's it's so crazy for me to like look back at at the stuff that I used to do I'm like how did I do that because I was such a like machine just an endless just stream of like work and content but it was also dumb and bad and meaningless and that's why it was so easy to turn it out and also I was an NPC because I did not have the Holy Spirit in me and I was just like operating like in this world like literally a robot like work pay attention to me make money like really really needed Jesus behold our God Seated on his throne come let us adore him Behold our King nothing can compare come let us adore oh speaking of behold our God I want to record a cover of that and I also have to say thank you and I'm sorry to anybody who's literally ever ordered from look design because it has been slow Shi times poor packaging bad customer service like listen I know I know and I'm so grateful to you I'm so grateful to you I'm trying so hard I'm trying so hard and when I come back with like the next like iteration I'm I promise I'm going to do better each time does get better I know it's still bad but it is getting better and I'm trying to be more consistent I'm trying to be more transparent and uh just dude thank you thank you for sticking around I'm sorry I'm sorry sorry that I'm not good at this I'm trying if I forgot someone um forgive me like I look back at so many situations and I just feel embarrassed and I feel shame but then I remember there is no condemnation or shame in Christ and that I've been wiped clean and Jesus forgives me and I can hope that you guys forgive me but I I can't force that but I do want to say that if there's anybody out there who feels like they owe me an apology or feels like you know feels like maybe they did me dirty a little bit you know if we had an inter interaction or an altercation of any type um I just want you to know I forgive you too so if there's a question on whether or not we have beef we absolutely do not not on my end anyways um I love literally everyone I love you all even when it hurts even when it's hard I love everyone I forgive everybody because my God Jesus Christ loved me and forgave me when I did not deserve it and before I even asked so I could not hold any unforgiveness in my heart and I want to apologize for all the

this uploaded today the 10th or tomorrow the 11th either way I want to say a quick prayer as you know God it is uh almost the anniversary of September 11th 2001 which shook America a lot of us many of us remember where we were what we were wearing what was going on around us like it it truly changed life forever it changed our perspective it changed the way we traveled it changed the way we looked at each other the way we communicated life changed in that moment and things have gotten worse God we pray for the victims and the the families of the victims that they've found peace we pray that they've Found Love and rest we pray for the heroes on that day and the days after we we applaud the volunteers we applaud those who sacrificed their lives for the lives of others we don't always understand tragedy we know that there is evil in this world and and we know that you love us enough to give us free will so that we aren't just mere worship robots here to serve you you give us the choice to serve you and we know that when people choose to not serve you that horrible things happen God I don't understand what you're doing but I trust you fully I trust that those lost who put their faith in you are in heaven with you now Lord I put my faith in you that I also will be in heaven with you and death has lost its sting when I put my faith and love and trust in you I pray that peace over everybody listening to this right now I pray for peace in our country I pray that you raise up strong leaders I pray that you knock the Arrogant leaders of our world today to their knees I pray that you shake them hard with Revelation and the fear of God I pray that the people open their eyes and begin to vote for us and not for them I pray that we the people can join together again a nation divided cannot stand it's no longer us against them it's us against everyone I pray God for the whole world to join in one body in Christ and turn to you even now you said you said even now you can turn to me and you promise to be a shield and a protector and a guide and a provider but we are one body and if so much of the body is sick the body doesn't function we have to stand together as one body Lord I pray that for this nation for this world for our small towns for our communities for our schools for our churches I pray that we be become one body every part of the body important equally cherished equally thank you God for humbling me thank you for calling me home when I went missing thank you for the discipline that I needed to be the woman I am today who's dedicated to serving you I pray all these things in Jesus name amen,On,Original

Even though my only intentions were to share joy and to give support to the church through the benefit concert many have felt offended about the incident I was in and with my performance which caused distress. I truly sincerely apologize.. This is a lesson learned and it is assured that it will not be repeated. I am not perfect but please know that I have strong beliefs and my faith is unbreakable and cannot be shaken. I pray that we can all move forward with compassion in our hearts. Thank you. 🙏,On,Original
