1,if you ve being held captive johnny blink twice

3,dude the first time i saw this i thought it was just another stupid overdramatic apology video    but now i just feel so bad for him  honestly this is pretty damn real hes not mock crying theres no defense no cuts no ads  and yes hes talking slow but hes probably tired and heartbroken  god i m so glad he recovered  poor guy   
4,she s the only youtuber ive seen that didn t make any excuses just admitted she was wrong and moved on from it
4,the person that never deserved to be canceled
4,it s been  years and i still miss her i hope she comes back eventually
4, it wasn t my intention to do blackface but that doesn t matter the only thing that matters is that i offended people   you are a beautiful person 
4,this is actually the most genuine apology i ve ever seen and it brought me to tears    and no one asked for it  no one was trying to cancel her  not saying what she did was okay by any means but i respect her for this 
5,that wasn t an apology  
5,hey guys so yesterday i ended my career  it s such a crazy time 
5,not all of us can just stay at home  not all jobs you can work from home 
5,why does the lady talking sound like she s falling asleep lmao
5,what a dumb thing to say   even if you think that way   
6,these people are horrible  would they get rid of a biological child who had special needs    adoption is forever  they let everyone know about hux when they adopted him  they never had respect for his privacy it was all about the almighty dollar 
6,if they really loved that child they wouldn t have given up on him   
6,it s not about me at all but the last few months have been so hard on me
6,i see a lot of  poor me poor me and not poor hux 
6,did she thank huxley for making you a millionaire before she trashed him

7,this should be in a movie
7,bro facepalming and shi 
7,now he broke the world record for rap tour tickets with over   million tickets sold    crazy how this didn t cancel him that s crazy and i got to experience him live my teenage life is complete
8,you d think two famous actors could actually manage an at least somewhat convincing apology 
8,i see why topher grace never wanted to hang with any of these people offscreen 
8,for professional actors they sure don t act well  they don t look apologetic  they look annoyed that the world dares to judge them defending a convicted rapist 
8,they were intended for the judge to read   meaning they never expected their support to be made public 
8,please don t let our support for a convicted raprist hurt our careers   we re sorry that the public heard about our letters 
9,the amount of racists in this comment section is astronomical
9,she is playing the victim  no she does not feel sorry  you can tell she is annoyed she can t comprehend her wrongdoings  racism in the bible belt the republican south is deep rooted 
9, i is what i is  
9,all that crying but i have yet to see one tear 
9,as a young black man who used to work for airport security down in savannah ga and have run into paula deen in person several times can say wholeheartedly and without a doubt that this woman was absolutely warm and kind to me the entire time i had to look through her things at the checkpoint  mind you the same people in this forum who are relentlessly hurling  racist  at this woman if i had to simply do my job by searching your belongings you d spout off all kinds of crazy shit and snatch your bag back like a seven year old child  we all talk shit at some point  just because you say something once it should not define who you are as a person  yeah it would piss me off or shock me but damn i don t have a heaven or hell to put this woman in and god knows i ve said and done some things in my life that i regret  she s only human and you can only be so strong before it really starts hurting you  if i want god to forgive me love me and accept me i have to forgive others and know that we don t always say or do the right things  it doesn t make us bad people  just people  life is a long journey and we will always make mistakes no matter how many lessons we learn 
10,i will not attempt to justify my actions  justifies actions
10, donotstandwithgnomestar 
10,he s made mistakes  also his parents
10,i wonder why the likes and dislikes are disabled  
10, minutes  hah no thank you 
11,it took god  years to teach you those basic human values  bakit kapag may mali kang nagawa dinadamay mo pa ang diyos  it s all your doing  grow up alex 
11,si lord nanaman kahit si lord pagod na sa mga pinaggagagawa mo
11,this apology could have appeared genuine if only kuya allan wasn t instructed to execute that handwritten note  
11,congrats  at  you learned something kids already know at  years old  proud of u
11,te hindi ka nilagay ni lord sa ganong sitwasyon para mambastos ka  nambastos ka kase gawain mo sya talaga  ginamit mo pa si lord kakaloka ka   magsorry ka nalang kung magsosorry ka  gagamitin mo pa si lord na kesyo it was a lesson he taught you  sayo yan hindi sa diyos 
12,yo i watched your whole trip   read some users comments along the way     right up to this response   as well as phillips vids  i think you handled the whole delicate thing very well     bravo    respect    peace
12,you re out of your mind  this is what happens when your phoney  be positive all the time  vibe gets the best of you  you obviously have never seen any of the vice documentaries on north korea or read newspapers about the human rights violations  it s not hard to find 
12,i wish people would just take these vlogs for what they are  of course we all know north korea is messed up  this surfing group is making a positive connection and influence with them and allowing north koreans to make their own decisions about who foreigners are and what they stand for  kudos to louis for his heart for all people and his wisdom and tact in how he does so  keep up the good work 
12,okay so you are saying that the media only shows  the bad   but aren t you just as guilty only showing  the good   this is basically like a video visiting a slave plantation in the s in america and showing only the good that comes from slavery and not showing any of the bad  slavery was very beneficial to society and it made a lot of people rich and happy  but it was also horrible and evil    north korea has some good stuff in it  but the bad is so enormous ever present and all encompassing that it snuffs out any possibility of the good being anything but a footnote  next time you go to north korea try talking about the bible or capitalism or anything that the government disagrees with  you can do that in south korea  you can t in north korea 
12,i kind of agree with the criticism of this but i am also on your side too  you are just showing us the good side and largely ignoring the problems there but    what are they expecting you to do  make vlogs on executions and torture  it s not really up to you to highlight and expose socioeconomic and political issues is it  your channel wouldn t have  fun  in the title for long if it was  there s nothing really you could do differently  so just keep doing what you re doing   north korea is going to be a touchy subject no matter what 
13,max would go on to never combine words ever again 
13,at least he wasn t fighting balrog when he said it
13,i m black and i laughed when he said it as well i know it was a slip of the tongue  i ve watched his streams b and i know he s cool guy  i hope no one gives him a bad time 
13,this dude is way to nice and pure to be racist 
13,lmao so max is a racist now  seriously stop  the dude literally has black friends and an asian wife xd
14, i don t care about the money  puts ads on apology video 
14,i don t always apologize  but when i do   i don t 
14,i m glad that my adblock doesn t let her have that ad revenue
14,idubbbz  says the n word tana  tells him to kill himself  jake paul  says the n word tana  marries him
14,tana is deleting her comments faster than hillary emails
15,jontron being serious is the scariest thing ever 
15,just realised jontron looks like every age at once
15,every time i see this i think about how much more chest hair i have than jontron and wonder if that s a good thing or not
15,i appreciate jon researched the irish after the fact 
15,literally everything he says here is   true  aged like a fine wine 
16,worst week of our life yeah you gave them damage for their whole lives  your disguisting 
16,all abusers r sorry once they get caught  they weren t sorry when they were abusing the kids
16, we just wanted our kids to be happy   throws cody s toys away destroys cody s ds and yells at him and alex 
16,notice how they just feel sorry for themselfs and not the kids
16,notice how angry mike looks throughout the whole video  he knows he s lost his meal ticket 
17,  is when he starts his  apology   like if i helped
17,y don t u apologize to alyssa directly  
17,why don t you try being a human and actually say sorry to her
17,who else came from alissa s video  like   if you re really sorry then name every person you hurt   god
17,when your acting classes from disney come in handy
18,im  years late but you can tell its genuine 
18, no fake crying  no dumb excuses  is mature  owned up  didn t ignore it that right there is a king 
18,it s ok felix it was a canon event 
18,still the best apology video i ve ever seen after the recent video 
18,he already has a lifetime n word pass from edgar
19,what  for  years that once boy has been tortured from the assault   you give spacey a pass because he was allegedly drunk   twistedsick
19,why did you even have a  year old at your apartment for a party where alcohol was being consumed   
19,my uncle raped me over  years ago  i guess i should let it go since it was  yrs ago  that is basically what you re implying
19,you just made the queer community look terrible so thanks  also way to turn this into your coming out story 
19,holy cow  if you re reading this story and perceiving kevin spacey to be the hero    you re reading it wrong 
20,i made a mistake  and it was my fault   no tears no deep breathing or long pauses just owning up to something like an adult   i still watch this because it s relieving to know people like jenna exist 
20,so many youtubers make apology videos for cheating doing terrible things comitting crimes doing drugs   whatever else   you make an apology video for your fish   honestly i feel like you re the only sane person on this platform   thank you for being precious and inspiring 
20,laura lee  not even a  minute apology video for tweeting horribly racist things jenna marbles   minute apology video for buying the wrong fish tank    
20,things i learned    no circle tank   real plants   fish breed research   jenna is best at fixing her mistakes   fish cycles   pet store employees probably ain t shit  not always    jenna community is probably best community
20,i love how emotional she s getting over the fish it really shows how big of a heart she has  
21,also it sounds like he is competing in a poetry slam    not apologizing 
21,how u cry with no tears  what is he sniffling for jeez 
21,this just in  reagan is angery
21,he showed more emotion in his vlog when his dog died he cried actual tears and looked distraught  but this  apology  video was pure bs all this crying with zero tears plus he looks like he s about to start laughing all the way through this  he knows his wife won t leave him and thinks he can fool everyone else too 
21,he definitely didnt get a callback
22,imagine if he went this video wouldn t be possible without raid shadow legends
22,before i start the apology  this video was sponsored by raid shadow legends
22,bro had chatgpt early access
22,travis scott s apology makes this look like a masterpiece
22,canadians when they accidentally bump someone on the shoulder 
23, that    of ignorant people you were talking about was pretty much alot of your youtube friends and fans worried about you making those videos  no hate  good luck 
23, it s not a prank what it is is acting   this guy makes me feel smart 
23, hey sorry that i scared the shit out of thousands of my fans and made them want to harm themselves  guess i m just too creative    
23,so    were positive fans   were innocent fans and then   were negative   so there s  numbers in a percentage    ok logic 
23,allow me to summarize  hello i m jake i am a huge douche please don t criticize me i have very thin skin    jake 
24,i m not gonna lie i knew that would cause backlash as i watched it  but i know your intentions were not malicious at all 
24,you have a great opportunity now to do a video with a local food bank and really inform people about what they do and the types of people they service   everyone makes mistakes     it s what we do to correct them that really counts  thanks 
24,legit u were more sorry and sincere for spending one pound in a day that logan paul was for  showing a dead body on camera and being completely disrespectful to a suicide victim
24,i ve watched u for four years  its first time u made a right spanner of yourself  well done for making this video but please please in future remember how lucky u are in the position ur in
24,i despised your last video but i have such a mad respect for you owning up to your actions and calling yourself out sets a great example for your younger viewers
25,thank you for this lucky ily
25,thank u for this maloi 
25,thank you for listening lucky  blooms will always be here 
25,thank you for taking accountability and hoping that everyone will be educated moving forward  love you maloi  
25,sometimes we win sometimes we learn  thank you for acknowledging and taking accountability  
26,honestly me apologizing to someone i hate because mom forced me to apologize
26,she s not sorry for the racist tweets she s sorry that she got caught
26,her tears are as existent as jeffree star s eyebrows
26,her tears are faker than my happiness
26,my  yr old self trying convince my mom not to ground me 
27,this felt like i was sitting with a friend it felt honest and real  this is an apology video 
27,laura isn t getting hate for the tweet  she s getting hate for her racism  you didn t force her to be racist  don t take responsibility for that 
27,you seem very well spoken and self aware i think you re hanging with the wrong crowd 
27,hands down the best apology video on youtube
27,i feel like you re being genuine and you got sucked into a vortex of bad energy   lesson learned 
28,how are you so comically unaware
28,judge  ricegum killed someone ricegum  other people did it too
28,proof that brains and money don t always go together 
28,omg ricegum invented a new challenge  the  try not to apologize  challenge
28,ricegum doesn t apologize but blames other youtubers  that s how mafia works 
29,translation  you re just sorry you got caught and punished this time 
29,appreciate you taking full responsibility  us runners are a forgiving bunch  see you out on the roads somewhere else 
29,big respect here 
29,such a fake apology  i m sure if you didn t get banned you wouldn t be doing this  some athlete 
29,this is literally the third time you ve done this and faced backlash   so why should anyone believe you are being genuine now  if you truly are sorry do some work on yourself and try to do something for the running community that s not motivated by your own fame  until then you are just expressing that you are sorry you got caught 
30,the fact that this video didn t have a single ad
30,when he started talking about his mother legit his tone went aggressive like yes sis defend your mom 
30,and the comments arent off james   you re a king 
30,the way he was treated by the adults was not ok 
30,the fact that she cared more about your loyalty to her brand rather than your safety at an event  
31,you handled this well i know we don t know each other but i m happy you handled it like this
31,respect bro  i hope you find your peace with your family
31,i like how you directly addressed his points and took the blame for some stuff  mad respect bro
31,i feel like jj really hides his intelligence very well until he wants to show it
31,when he said   stop saying my parents and say our parents im a part of this family  bro my eyes started watering
32,unless you wrote cotton fibers on the ingredients list      they re contaminated  that s the definition of the word 
32,i m here for the explanation for the messy lipsticks i didn t buy
32,i encourage everyone to watch the video about jaclyn s lipsticks by kenna  she is a biochemist and explains the inconsistencies in jaclyn s explanation 
32,guys her lipstick is perfectly safe it only has plastic metal hairs and unidentifiable hard black objects  ignore the odd texture and unpleasant odors clumpy texture and an other alarming issues  it s totally safe    
32,why does she keep saying how her ingredients are fda approved and safe to use  hun people never had any problems with the ingredients they have issues with the contamination  also good  fda approved ingredients expire at some point which is the other issue people have  recall     
33,this year is not your year huh 
33,if a cop caught you going nearly  in a  you would be going to jail lmao
33,t s definitely the most reckless thing you ve done but in the last month or so you continue to damage your reputation  first the wallpaper app then the speeding now you re doing  minute sponsor videos you once said you d never do   its digging into your overall credibility
33,lots of people will remain unhappy but this is a good apology  you did a very dumb thing  we ve all done something stupid before  you recognize it s dumb and you aim to be do better  that s way more than most people will do  thanks for being straight up and addressing it 
33,good decision   respect for owning up to it so quickly
34,i do not want a refund    i loved the documentary  i have enjoyed my journey of watching you two on you quest for  countries  don t stop now   you have  countries left to see
34,it did not remotely hurt my feelings  you guys work so hard and i didn t have a problem paying to watch  keep doing what you re doing 
34,can t believe you had  emails complaining about   charge for something you worked hard on for weeks  what is wrong with people  keep smiling  xx
34,honestly stop  i ve been following you through your entire journey  how on earth could anyone get angry    you make a lot of content  you should get paid for your work  of course you should charge for us watching a full length documentary    no apology please   
34,i happily paid for the video and wished i had the budget to pay more than i did  it was incredible  i enjoyed every second  y all have touched so many lives and inspired so much travel and adventure  i know kara poured her heart into it and i m so sorry it wasn t met with everything but love  i loved seeing how you got started and they way you recapped all the countries  can t wait to see what s next for y all 
35,yes this is how you apologize  no crying and she s admitting her wrong without bringing others in it  i love this 
35,i never was a fan of her or her miranda character  but to be completely unbiased this was the perfect apology  wow other youtubers need to take notes on how to make genuine and mature apologies    
35,she has grown backwards  she is addressing it now with disney ukelele song 
35,im glad she stuck up for herself without pointing anyone out  she is so mature and doesn t deserve to be hated on 
35,colleen is literally the most mature person talking abt her mistakes tho she is amazing and we love you colleen   
36,this episode of black mirror doesn t sit right with me    poor acting i guess
36,this was a  minute run on sentence 
36,someone said you re not this literate
36,it sounds like the fine print of a prescription drug commercial 
36,this video feels like a teacher giving the class the talk after everyone treated the sub bad the day before 
37,this is the literal definition of  i ve won but at what cost  
37,not a single dark souls joke reference was made verdict  this man is serious
37,no dark souls reference i fully believe every word you say
37,how tf people expect him to groom a kid when he cant even groom his hair
37,the first piece of content colossal has created in a year and it s reading out fat furry roleplay
38,for everyone saying dom should make an apology that probably wouldn t be appropriate  he needs to go to jail 
38,imagine outta no where he says this video wouldn t be possible without seatgeek
38,i love how we all went and watched all the yt apologies after we watched colleen s 
38,dom doesn t need to do an apology he needs to be in jail 
38,you know it s an apology video when they re adjusting the camera 
39,thing is there s a lot of comments here saying we forgive you will but to be honest it isn t for us to forgive him  it s up to chris  he can only make that call 
39,can t believe will was able to nearly perfectly pull off the youtuber apology video after only  months of training 
39,will could really use that rewind button right about now 
39,will has undergone his full youtuber arc which is the infamous apology video 
39, she had nothing to do with this   she s literally the reason for this on multiple fronts 
40,the liver king is speedrunning the influencer lifestyle  barely a year in the game and he s already making an apology video lmao
40,the fact that people believed he was natty at all is mind boggling
40,i lied because people are killing themselves is a wild take
40,i had major depression  and attempted suicide many times   but i was saved when a millionaire with an unachievable physique lied about not abusing steroids   now i m cured of depression 
40,new ancestral tenents      be a liar    mislead your audience    double down on lies whenever asked because     involved    when found out try scape goating men s mental health    step  only necessary if exposed 
41,idubbbz is the only person on the internet who didn t get canceled for being racist and got canceled for not being racist 
41,for what it s worth i ll always remember you as the guy who heard say something gay jumped from the countertop and said i m gay  genuinely peak of comedy 
41,you weren t funny because you were offensive you are just a very funny dude  you can be the self aware you and still be funny 
41,there are some people who fully deserved the content cop that they got 
41,this is the most australian looking non australian ever 
42,apology video ft bloopers 
42,it s over for bro
42,what happened 
42,what a sincere apology
42,apology with bloopers is crazy
43,you shouldve listened to the pr team girl
43,this response was a choice
43,i actually can t believe this is real  the sad thing is that it is clear she put a bunch of effort into this song 
43,i had a feeling colleen would come back and do something like this
43,well i have to hand it to her  this is the most original apology video i ve seen 
44, don t judge a company for errors look how they react to critique     linus sebastian  you said it now live and work by it 
44,you gotta hire a qa qc specialist for your all testing projects in labs never let the person that makes something also control the quality 
44,those   they saved by not testing the water block properly has cost them a tiny bit more than expected
44,terrence my guy good job on reading from the teleprompter  without blinking even once
44,well this certainly takes us back to linus own words   always judge a company based on how they respond to criticism  
45,this man threatened sexual violence against a small child     he does not need a platform  he s lost it on women too and showed what his dad does to his mom behind closed doors 
45,we made the wrong guy famous 
45,its an apology not a stuttering contest
45,lyrics   yap yap yap yap yap yap umm yap yap yap umm yap yap yap yap umm umm yap yap yap umm yap yap yap yap yap yap yap yap umm yap  i counted a total of  umms in this video  
45,sure bro  we ll see  how many times u gonna apologize
46,the ex buzzfeed employee to three guys on the apology couch pipeline is insane  
46,my favorite videos from watcher are still the pandemic are you scared vids where it s just ryan and shane on zoom  please don t feel like you have to blow your budget on production when we just want to see y all hang out and tell each other scary stories  i love you guys and felt like your shows gave me some much needed laughs during a difficult time  thank you for hearing our concerns and actually making changes  it really means a lot 
46,as someone who still binge watches buzzfeed unsolved videos to this day i have to say that it really saddens me to see how these guys have evolved  we never asked for these fancy production rooms and effects we watched because of the relationship between ryan and shane  you guys could shoot a video inside a cardboard box and i wouldn t care because i m here for the personality not the special graphics
46,y all need to know we would watch shane and ryan walk through and ambiguously haunted vet clinic with two iphone cameras live streaming  we dont need the fancy stuff   my favourite videos are where its just those two reading stories hanging out  youve got two great personalities and a dynamic duo  no need to overpower it with a bunch of unnecessary expenses
46,you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become  guys on a couch
47,why are you apologizing  stop giving into this cancel culture shit like it s really not that serious
47,lmao truth   forced apology  china doesn t care about the environment
47,people should be more upset about the pollution than commenting on it 
47,kyedae i think i speak for everyone when i say we forgive you your apology has been accepted and we are no longer angry      
47,why are people mad about this  it s just a fact that china s air is polluted and can be damageable to more vulnerable people in regards to health
48,its giving my pastor told me i had to make ammends to make it into heaven so here i am doing the bare minimum 
48,to apologize to everyone and no one at the same time is a talent she definitely has 
48,thank you gabbie i m happy to see you in a better place now  
48,this is not an apology  this is performative and self aggrandisement  apologise to the individuals you wronged you called one of them a talentless loser a few weeks ago that s who you really are and not everyone buys this rebrand  do better 
48,this is not how a grown adult apologizes   what are you sorry for  who are you saying sorry to  what behaviors are referring to  this is performative insincere and just as vague as any other  apology  she s ever offered anyone 
49,tama nga naman julie  talaga lang may mga feeling perfect  just stand still and learn the lesson from it 
49,yan ang tunay na julie anne san jose marunong tumanggap ng kamalian 
49,hugs clarita god bless you
49,naintindihan ko
49,it s ok mas nagkasala pa ung nag bash sayu
