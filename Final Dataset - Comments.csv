0,"""We're sorry that you're too stupid to understand how this works"", is basically the sum of this apology in one sentence. So yeah, classic arrogant non-apology."
0,apology? they told their fans that they are too stupid to understand their idea..
0,"I love when apologies go more then beyond ""im sorry i was wrong"". Because it than somehow mutates into ""so you see.. You're actually the ones at fault."""
0,"Sounds like they're both holding back PURE RAGE AND HATRED

I feel like I'm being lectured by my parents about how it was wrong to punch my teacher"
0,They're not apologizing they're just saying how dumb their fans are and that we're just too dumb to get  what they're saying!!
1,Im impressed they both managed to keep straight faces.
1,"You can't see it, but there's a man behind the camera pointing a gun at their dogs' heads and giving them flash cards to read off of."
1,"Little did he know, this would be the least embarrassing thing he would have to do publicly with Amber Heard...."
1,"If you‚Äôve being held captive, Johnny, blink twice."
1,"I can‚Äôt believe she took advantage of Johnny Depp‚Äôs love for her, like this. He was already in Australia and she met him there, meaning this was all her doing. She‚Äôd also done the same thing in the past and got away with it. Unbelievable."
2,"""Sorry guys my bad, your fault"""
2,Plot twist: The dog was the one pulling the strings this whole time.
2,"The background was my favorite.

""I'm sorry I scammed you guys of money, but look - I spent it all pretty well"""
2,"""I am sorry I got caught, my bad guys."""
2,I like how he parked his car perfectly into frame in the background just to rub it in more.
3,The first time I‚Äôve had to speed up a James Charles video
3,"James: am so sorry tati for what i put you through

Me: Why did james even apologize?"
3,Why is he talking so slow... not like him.
3,"omg he APPOLOGIZED.
can they not see that he is a kind person and he loves them?

I think THEY need to apologize to HIM."
3,"dude the first time I saw this I thought it was just another stupid overdramatic apology video... but now I just feel so bad for him. honestly this is pretty damn real, hes not mock crying, theres no defense, no cuts, no ads. and yes hes talking slow but hes probably tired and heartbroken. god I'm so glad he recovered. poor guy :("
4,"she‚Äôs the only youtuber ive seen that didn‚Äôt make any excuses, just admitted she was wrong and moved on from it"
4,The person that never deserved to be canceled
4,"it‚Äôs been 3 years and I still miss her, I hope she comes back eventually"
4,"""It wasn't my intention to do blackface, but that doesn't matter, the only thing that matters is that I offended people.""
You are a beautiful person."
4,This is actually the most genuine apology I‚Äôve ever seen and it brought me to tears :( and no one asked for it. No one was trying to cancel her. Not saying what she did was okay by any means but I respect her for this.
5,That wasn‚Äôt an apology!!
5,"‚ÄúHey guys, so yesterday I ended my career. It‚Äôs such a crazy time.‚Äù"
5,Not all of us can just ‚Äústay at home.‚Äù Not all jobs you can work from home.
5,Why does the lady talking sound like she‚Äôs falling asleep lmao
5,What a DUMB thing to say!! Even if you think that way...
6,"these people are horrible! would they get rid of a biological child who had special needs??? adoption is forever! they let everyone know about Hux when they adopted him! they never had respect for his privacy, it was all about the almighty dollar!"
6,If they really loved that child they wouldn‚Äôt have given up on him...
6,‚Äúit‚Äôs not about me at all but the last few months have been so hard on me‚Äù
6,"I see a lot of ""poor me, poor me, and not poor Hux"""
6,Did she thank Huxley for making you a millionaire before she trashed him?
7,Crazy how Travis Scott created a magnitude 1.5 earthquake at his fein concert
7,This will forever be funny to me

7,Bro facepalming and shi 
7,"now he broke the world record for rap tour tickets with over 1.5 million tickets sold... crazy how this didn't cancel him that's crazy, and I got to experience him live my teenage life is complete"
8,You‚Äôd think two famous actors could actually manage an at least somewhat convincing apology.
8,I see why Topher Grace never wanted to hang with any of these people offscreen.
8,For professional actors they sure don't act well. They don't look apologetic. They look annoyed that the world dares to judge them defending a convicted rapist.
8,"‚ÄúThey were intended for the judge to read.‚Äù

Meaning, they never expected their support to be made public."
8,Please don't let our support for a convicted raprist hurt our careers!  We're sorry that the public heard about our letters!
9,The amount of racists in this comment section is astronomical
9,"She is playing the victim. No, she does not feel sorry. You can tell she is annoyed, she can't comprehend her wrongdoings.
Racism in the Bible Belt, the Republican South, is deep rooted."
9,"""I is what I is."""
9,All that ‚Äúcrying‚Äù but I have yet to see one tear.
9,"As a young black man who used to work for airport security down in Savannah, GA and have run into Paula Deen in person several times can say wholeheartedly and without a doubt that this woman was absolutely warm and kind to me the entire time I had to look through her things at the checkpoint. Mind you, the same people in this forum who are relentlessly hurling ""racist"" at this woman, if I had to simply DO my job by searching your belongings, you'd spout off all kinds of crazy shit and snatch your bag back like a seven year old child. WE ALL TALK SHIT at some point. Just because you say something once, it should not DEFINE who you are as a person. Yeah, it would piss me off or shock me, but damn, I don't have a heaven or hell to put this woman in and God knows I've said and done some things in my life that I regret. She's only human and you can only be so strong before it really starts hurting you. If I want God to forgive me, love me, and accept me, I have to forgive others and know that we don't always say or do the right things. It doesn't make us bad people. Just people. Life is a long journey and we will always make mistakes no matter how many lessons we learn."
10,"I will not attempt to justify my actions"" justifies actions"

10,He's made mistakes. Also his parents
10,I wonder why the likes and dislikes are disabled üòÇ
10,"50 minutes? Hah
no thank you."
11,"It took God 35 years to teach you those basic human values? Bakit kapag may mali kang nagawa, dinadamay mo pa ang Diyos? It‚Äôs all your doing. Grow up, Alex!"
11,si lord nanaman kahit si lord pagod na sa mga pinaggagagawa mo
11,This apology could have appeared genuine if only Kuya Allan wasn‚Äôt instructed to execute that handwritten note üòë
11,"Congrats. At 35, you learned something kids already know at 7 years old. Proud of u"
11,"Te, hindi ka nilagay ni Lord sa ganong sitwasyon para mambastos ka. Nambastos ka kase gawain mo sya talaga. Ginamit mo pa si Lord, kakaloka ka.

Magsorry ka nalang kung magsosorry ka. Gagamitin mo pa si Lord na kesyo it was a lesson he taught you. Sayo yan, hindi sa Diyos."
12,"YO, I watched your whole trip & read some users comments along the way...  right up to this response. (as well as Phillips vids) I think you handled the whole delicate thing very well. .. Bravo .. respect .. peace"
12,"You're out of your mind. This is what happens when your phoney ""be positive all the time"" vibe gets the best of you. You obviously have NEVER seen any of the VICE documentaries on North Korea or read newspapers about the human rights violations. It's not hard to find."
12,"I wish people would just take these vlogs for what they are. Of course we all know North Korea is messed up. This surfing group is making a positive connection and influence with them, and allowing North Koreans to make their own decisions about who foreigners are and what they stand for. Kudos to Louis for his heart for all people, and his wisdom and tact in how he does so. Keep up the good work."
12,"Okay, so you are saying that the media only shows ""the bad"". But aren't you just as guilty, only showing ""the good""? This is basically like a video visiting a slave plantation in the 1800s in America and showing only the good that comes from slavery, and not showing any of the bad. Slavery was very beneficial to society and it made a lot of people rich and happy. But it was also horrible and evil. 

North Korea has some good stuff in it. But the bad is so enormous, ever-present, and all-encompassing, that it snuffs out any possibility of the good being anything but a footnote. Next time you go to North Korea, try talking about the Bible, or Capitalism, or anything that the government disagrees with. You can do that in South Korea. You can't in North Korea."
12,"I kind of agree with the criticism of this, but I am also on your side too. You ARE just showing us the good side and largely ignoring the problems there but... What are they expecting you to do? Make vlogs on executions and torture? It's not really up to you to highlight and expose socioeconomic and political issues is it? Your channel wouldn't have ""Fun"" in the title for long if it was. There's nothing really you could do differently,  so just keep doing what you're doing.  North Korea is going to be a touchy subject no matter what."
13,Max would go on to never combine words ever again.
13,At least he wasn't fighting Balrog when he said it
13,"I'm black and i laughed when he said it as well, i know it was a slip of the tongue. I've watched his streams b4 and i know he's cool guy..i hope no one gives him a bad time."
13,This dude is way to nice and pure to be racist.
13,Lmao so Max is a Racist now? Seriously stop. The dude literally has Black friends and an Asian wife XD
14,"""I don't care about the money"" puts ads on apology video!"
14,"I don't always apologize 
But when I do

14,Tana is deleting her comments faster than Hillary emails
15,Jontron being serious is the scariest thing ever.
15,Just realised jontron looks like every age at once
15,every time I see this I think about how much more chest hair I have than JonTron and wonder if that's a good thing or not
15,I appreciate Jon researched the Irish after the fact.
15,"Literally everything he says here is 1,000,000% true. Aged like a fine wine."
16,‚ÄúWorst week of our life‚Äù Yeah you gave them damage for their whole lives. Your disguisting.
16,All abusers r sorry once they get caught. They weren‚Äôt sorry when they were abusing the kids
16,"""We Just Wanted Our Kids To Be Happy.""
Throws Cody's Toys Away, Destroys Cody's DS and yells at him and Alex."
16,notice how they just feel sorry for themselfs and not the kids
16,Notice how angry Mike looks throughout the whole video. He knows he's lost his meal ticket.
17,"10:36 is when he starts his ""apology"". Like if I helped"
17,y don't u apologize to Alyssa directly!?
17,why don't you try being a human and actually say sorry to her
17,Who else came from Alissa's video? Like.. if you're really sorry then NAME EVERY PERSON YOU HURT!! GOD
17,when your acting classes from disney come in handy

18,"It‚Äôs ok Felix, it was a canon event."
18,still the best apology video I've ever seen after the recent video.
18,He already has a lifetime n-word pass from Edgar
19,What? For 30 years that once boy has been tortured from the assault & you give Spacey a pass because he was allegedly drunk? #TwistedSick
19,Why did you even have a 14 year old at your apartment for a party where alcohol was being consumed???
19,My uncle raped me over 30 years ago. I guess I should let it go since it was 30 yrs ago. That is basically what you're implying
19,"You just made the queer community look terrible, so, thanks. Also way to turn this into your coming out story?"
19,Holy cow. If you're reading this story and perceiving Kevin Spacey to be the hero... you're reading it wrong.
20,"‚ÄúI made a mistake. And it was my fault.‚Äù 
No tears, no deep breathing or long pauses, just owning up to something like an adult. 
I still watch this because it‚Äôs relieving to know people like Jenna exist."
20,"so many youtubers make apology videos for cheating, doing terrible things, comitting crimes, doing drugs.. whatever else.. You make an apology video for your fish.. honestly I feel like you're the only sane person on this platform.. thank you for being precious and inspiring."
20,"Laura Lee: Not even a 5-minute apology video for tweeting horribly racist things
Jenna Marbles: 47 minute apology video for buying the wrong fish tank ..."
20,"things i learned:
- no circle tank
- real plants
- fish breed research
- jenna is best at fixing her mistakes
- fish cycles
- pet store employees probably ain‚Äôt shit (not always)
- jenna community is probably best community"
20,"I love how emotional she's getting over the fish, it really shows how big of a heart she has‚ù§Ô∏è"
21,Also it sounds like he is competing in a poetry slam... not apologizing.
21,how u cry with no tears. what is he sniffling for jeez.
21,This just in: Reagan is ANGERY
21,"He showed more emotion in his vlog when his dog died, he cried actual tears and looked distraught. But this 'apology' video was pure bs, all this crying with zero tears plus he looks like he's about to start laughing all the way through this. He knows his wife won't leave him and thinks he can fool everyone else too."
21,He definitely didnt get a callback
22,Imagine if he went ‚ÄúThis video wouldn‚Äôt be possible without Raid Shadow Legends‚Äù
22,Before I start the apology: this video was sponsored by raid shadow legends
22,Bro had ChatGPT early access
22,Travis Scott‚Äôs apology makes this look like a masterpiece
22,Canadians when they accidentally bump someone on the shoulder:
23,"""That 2%"" of ignorant people you were talking about was pretty much alot of your YouTube friends and fans worried about you making those videos. No hate. Good luck."
23,"""it's not a prank, what it is IS ACTING""

this guy makes me feel smart."
23,"""Hey, sorry that I scared the shit out of thousands of my fans and made them want to harm themselves! Guess I'm just too creative :)"""
23,"so:
50% were positive fans
50% were innocent fans
and then 2% were negative?

so there‚Äôs 102 numbers in a percentage? 

ok, logic."
23,"Allow me to summarize,
""Hello I'm Jake, I am a huge douche, please don't criticize me I have very thin skin"" - Jake."
24,I'm not gonna lie I knew that would cause backlash as I watched it. But I know your intentions were not malicious at all.
24,You have a great opportunity now to do a video with a local food bank and really inform people about what they do and the types of people they service.  Everyone makes mistakes ... it's what we do to correct them that really counts. Thanks.
24,Legit u were more sorry and sincere for spending one pound in a day that Logan paul was for  showing a dead body on camera and being completely disrespectful to a suicide victim
24,I've watched u for four years. Its first time u made a right spanner of yourself. Well done for making this video but please please in future remember how lucky u are in the position ur in

26,Her tears are faker than my happiness
26,My 10 yr old self trying convince my mom not to ground me:
27,"This felt like I was sitting with a friend, it felt honest and real. THIS is an apology video."
27,Laura isn‚Äôt getting hate for the tweet. She‚Äôs getting hate for her racism. You didn‚Äôt force her to be racist. Don‚Äôt take responsibility for that.
27,"You seem very well spoken and self aware, I think you‚Äôre hanging with the wrong crowd."
27,Hands down the best apology video on YouTube
27,"I feel like you're being genuine and you got sucked into a vortex of bad energy. 
Lesson learned."
28,how are you so comically unaware
28,"Judge: Ricegum killed someone
Ricegum: Other people did it too"
28,proof that brains and money don't always go together.
28,"Omg ricegum invented a new challenge. The ""try not to apologize"" challenge"
28,Ricegum doesn‚Äôt apologize but blames other YouTubers: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how Mafia works‚Äù!
29,Translation: you're just sorry you got caught and punished this time.
29,Appreciate you taking full responsibility. Us runners are a forgiving bunch. See you out on the roads somewhere else.
29,Big respect here.
29,"Such a fake apology. I‚Äôm sure if you didn‚Äôt get banned, you wouldn‚Äôt be doing this. Some ‚Äúathlete‚Äù‚Ä¶"
29,"This is literally the third time you‚Äôve done this and faced backlash - so why should anyone believe you are being genuine now? If you truly are sorry, do some work on yourself and try to do something for the running community that‚Äôs not motivated by your own fame. Until then, you are just expressing that you are sorry you got caught."
30,The fact that this video didn‚Äôt have a single ad
30,"When he started talking about his mother, legit his tone went aggressive like yes sis defend your mom."
30,"And the comments arent off, James...you're a king."
30,The way he was treated by the adults was not ok.
30,the fact that she cared more about your ‚Äúloyalty‚Äù to her brand rather than your safety at an event üëÄ
31,"You handled this well, I know we don't know each other, but I'm happy you handled it like this"
31,Respect bro. I hope you find your peace with your family
31,I like how you directly addressed his points and took the blame for some stuff. Mad respect bro
31,I feel like JJ really hides his intelligence very well until he wants to show it
31,"When he said: ""stop saying my parents, and say our parents, im a part of this family"" bro my eyes started watering"
32,Unless you wrote COTTON FIBERS on the ingredients list..... They're CONTAMINATED. That's the definition of the word.
32,I‚Äôm here for the explanation for the messy lipsticks I didn‚Äôt buy
32,I encourage everyone to watch the video about Jaclyn‚Äôs lipsticks by Kenna. She is a biochemist and explains the inconsistencies in Jaclyn‚Äôs explanation.
32,"Guys Her lipstick is perfectly safe it only has plastic, metal, hairs, and unidentifiable hard black objects. Ignore the odd texture, and unpleasant odors clumpy texture and an other alarming issues. It‚Äôs totally safe ..."
32,"Why does she keep saying how her ingredients are FDA approved and safe to use? Hun, people never had any problems with the ingredients, they have issues with the CONTAMINATION. Also, good , FDA approved ingredients EXPIRE at some point, which is the other issue people have. RECALL!!!!!"
33,this year is not your year huh.
33,"If a cop caught you going nearly 100 in a 35, you would be going to jail lmao"
33,"t's definitely the most reckless thing you've done, but in the last month or so you continue to damage your reputation. First, the wallpaper app, then the speeding, now you're doing 9 minute sponsor videos you once said you'd never do.

Its digging into your overall credibility"
33,"Lots of people will remain unhappy, but this is a good apology. You did a very dumb thing (we‚Äôve all done something stupid before), you recognize it‚Äôs dumb, and you aim to be/do better. That‚Äôs way more than most people will do. Thanks for being straight up and addressing it."
33,Good decision & respect for owning up to it so quickly
34,"I DO NOT WANT A REFUND!!  I loved the documentary. I have enjoyed my journey of watching you two on you quest for 100 countries.
Don't stop now - you have 95 countries left to see"
34,It did not remotely hurt my feelings. You guys work so hard and I didn‚Äôt have a problem paying to watch. Keep doing what you‚Äôre doing!
34,Can't believe you had 400 emails complaining about $1 charge for something you worked hard on for weeks. What is wrong with people. Keep smiling. Xx
34,Honestly stop. I've been following you through your entire journey. How on earth could anyone get angry??? You make a lot of content. You should get paid for your work. Of course you should charge for us watching a full length documentary!!! No apology please :)
34,I happily paid for the video and wished I had the budget to pay more than I did! It was incredible. I enjoyed every second. Y'all have touched so many lives and inspired so much travel and adventure. I know Kara poured her heart into it and I'm so sorry it wasn't met with everything but love. I loved seeing how you got started and they way you recapped all the countries. Can't wait to see what's next for y'all!
35,"Yes, this is how you apologize. No crying and she‚Äôs admitting her wrong without bringing others in it. I love this!"
35,"I never was a fan of her or her Miranda character. But to be completely unbiased, this was the perfect apology. WOW other youtubers need to take notes on how to make genuine and mature apologies. üëçüèæ"
35,She has grown backwards. She is addressing it now with disney ukelele song.
35,im glad she stuck up for herself without pointing anyone out. she is so mature and doesn't deserve to be hated on.

36,this was a 14 minute run-on sentence.
36,Someone said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not this literate‚Äù
36,It sounds like the fine print of a prescription drug commercial.
36,This video feels like a teacher giving the class ‚Äúthe talk‚Äù after everyone treated the sub bad the day before.
37,"This is the literal definition of ""I've won, but at what cost?"""
37,Not a single dark souls joke/reference was made verdict: this man is serious
37,"No dark souls reference, I fully believe every word you say"
37,how tf people expect him to groom a kid when he cant even groom his hair
37,The first piece of content Colossal has created in a year and it's reading out fat furry roleplay
38,"For everyone saying Dom should make an apology, that probably wouldn‚Äôt be appropriate. He needs to go to jail."
38,Imagine outta no where he says ‚Äúthis video wouldn‚Äôt be possible without seatgeek‚Äù
38,I love how we all went and watched all the YT apologies after we watched colleen'süò≠
38,"Dom doesn‚Äôt need to do an apology, he needs to be in jail."
38,You know it‚Äôs an apology video when they‚Äôre adjusting the camera.
39,"Thing is, there‚Äôs a lot of comments here saying ‚Äúwe forgive you will‚Äù but to be honest it isn‚Äôt for us to forgive him. It‚Äôs up to Chris. He can only make that call."
39,Can‚Äôt believe Will was able to nearly perfectly pull off the YouTuber apology video after only 4 months of training.
39,Will could really use that rewind button right about now.
39,Will has undergone his full YouTuber arc which is the infamous ‚Äúapology video‚Äù 
39,"""She had nothing to do with this""

She's literally the reason for this, on multiple fronts."
40,The Liver King is speedrunning the influencer lifestyle. Barely a year in the game and he's already making an apology video lmao
40,The fact that people believed he was natty at all is mind boggling
40,‚ÄúI lied because people are killing themselves‚Äù is a wild take

42,Apology with bloopers is crazy
43,YOU SHOULDVE LISTENED TO THE PR TEAM GIRL
43,This response was a choice
43,I actually can't believe this is real. The sad thing is that it is clear she put a bunch of effort into this song.
43,I had a feeling Colleen would come back and do something like this
43,"Well, I have to hand it to her. This is the most original apology video I‚Äôve seen."
44,"""Don‚Äòt judge a company for errors, look how they react to critique."" - Linus Sebastian. You said it, now live and work by it."

44,Those $500 they saved by not testing the water block properly has cost them a tiny bit more than expected
44,Terrence my guy good job on reading from the teleprompter  without blinking even once
44,"Well, this certainly takes us back to Linus own words: ""Always judge a company based on how they respond to criticism""."

46,The ex-buzzfeed employee to three guys on the apology couch pipeline is insane üíÄ
46,My favorite videos from Watcher are still the pandemic ‚Äúare you scared‚Äù vids where it‚Äôs just Ryan and Shane on zoom. Please don‚Äôt feel like you have to blow your budget on production when we just want to see y‚Äôall hang out and tell each other scary stories. I love you guys and felt like your shows gave me some much needed laughs during a difficult time. Thank you for hearing our concerns and actually making changes. It really means a lot.
46,"as someone who STILL binge watches buzzfeed unsolved videos to this day, i have to say that it really saddens me to see how these guys have evolved. we never asked for these fancy production rooms and effects, we watched because of the relationship between ryan and shane. you guys could shoot a video inside a cardboard box and i wouldn't care because i‚Äôm here for the personality, not the special graphics"
46,"Y'all need to know we would watch Shane and Ryan walk through and ambiguously haunted vet clinic with two iphone cameras live streaming. We dont need the fancy stuff.
